  "text": "Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) is a professional discipline that focuses on developing and implementing optimal solutions from a system-level perspective.\n\"Industrial and Systems Engineers Make a Difference Everywhere\" (Source: USC Viterbi School of Engineering) \nThis involves people, technology, quality, finance, information, and environmental issues. The main role of an Industrial and Systems Engineer is to organize and work harmoniously with others to streamline operational procedures, improve productivity and enhance overall system performance. The ultimate goal is to increase efficiency, reduce operating costs, and ensure customer satisfaction.\nISE is different from other conventional engineering disciplines whereby knowledge and skills are applied to specific areas. For example, traditionally, manufacturing engineers usually work in a production environment. In contrast, ISE provides the skillsets which will enable practitioners to work in a variety of organizations across both the industrial and commercial sectors. ISE is well established in many universities worldwide, such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Washington, the University of Florida, and the National University of Singapore. Industrial and Systems Engineers have a much more flexible career path, as ISE graduates are widely employed in areas that include new product development, transportation, theme parks, logistic services, banks, public utilities, business development, consultancy enterprises, government departments, etc. The ultimate objective of the ISE discipline is to provide leadership in the design of integrated industrial and commercial systems for the advancement and well-being of society. \nThe Department is motivated by the world-wide industrial restructuring that is occurring as a result of rapid advances in technology, communication, and information technology. According to announced policies and strategies, the government has committed to expedite re-industrialisation, encourage smart manufacturing and support the engagement of local enterprises in advanced technologies, especially those related to Industry 4.0. Accordingly, the Department is offering professional academic programmes to meet these needs. Come join us, and when you graduate you can have a wide choice for a rewarding career and make a significant contribution to a better world. \nIn conclusion, we are committed not only to providing high quality education, but also to advancing academic and applied research. We strive to maintain our position as a leading department in this field in the region, through innovative practices in teaching and learning, applied research, and the promotion of knowledge transfer.\nClick here for more details about our research laboratories and facilities.\nThe Department is also actively engaged in collaboration with industry via joint research projects, consultancies, and teaching company schemes.\nThis strong collaboration with both local and regional industries, together with its excellent facilities and staff expertise, provides students with the opportunity to be immersed in this collaborative environment which will be of great benefit to them when they graduate.",

In our empirical work, we estimate the direct and indirect impact of code sharing on airfares in the African international connecting routes between 2017 and 2019. The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether cooperation helps to internalize double marginalization, and results in lower fares. Moreover, we check whether the effect of the introduction of code sharing percolates to airfares of non-CS itineraries on the same route where CS is adopted. Our main results show that the activation of a CS agreement generates a strong reduction of airfares equal to about -18%. The evidence regarding the CS spillover effect is mixed: in connecting interline itineraries we observe that, ceteris paribus, when code sharing is introduced on a route, non-CS airlines react by reducing their price of about 10%. In online or direct itineraries airlines seem not to react to CS introduction and this evidence suggests that they do not perceive CS products as a threat. Our findings support the idea that airline cooperation can play a role in the growth of the African aviation market.\nKeynote Speaker\nProf. Gianmaria Martini\nProfessor of Applied Economics \nDepartment of Economics, \nUniversità degli studi di Bergamo, \nBergamo, Italy. \nGianmaria Martini is a Professor of Applied Economics at the University of Bergamo and Director of the Department of Economics of the same university.

  "text": "Two research teams at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) contributed to the Nation’s first Mars exploration project Tianwen-1. By harnessing their extensive experience in the field of aerospace science and technology, as well as their commitment to research excellence, PolyU researchers played a vital role in the Tianwen-1 mission, in collaboration with the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST). Professor WU Bo helped identify possible landing regions with advanced topographic mapping and geomorphological analysis technologies. Professor YUNG Kai-leung developed a sophisticated space instrument, the “Mars Landing Surveillance Camera (Mars Camera)”, for capturing images of the surroundings of the Red Planet and monitoring the status of the Zhurong Mars rover.\nThe spacecraft for the Tianwen-1 probe comprises an orbiter, a lander and the Zhurong rover, aiming to complete orbiting, landing and roving in one single mission, which is the first such attempt in global aerospace history. The mission aims to obtain scientific exploration data on the Red Planet, and currently, Tianwen-1 has completed orbiting Mars and has successfully landed on a pre-selected landing region on the Utopia Planitia of Mars. The Mars rover Zhurong is also due to begin Martian exploration.\nDr LAM Tai-fai, Chairman of Council, PolyU, offered his warmest congratulations to the Nation on the successful soft landing of Tianwen-1. He said, “The Nation has developed an impressive track record in deep space exploration, such as its lunar exploration and lunar sample return missions. This time the Nation begins its planetary exploration journey by setting its sights on Mars for the first time, which further cements China’s advanced space capabilities. We are immensely encouraged that PolyU played a pivotal part in facilitating the Tianwen-1 mission. With extraordinary creativity, perseverance and innovative minds, our researchers will continue to contribute to the well-being of mankind in various scientific fields.”\nMr Alfred SIT, Secretary for Innovation and Technology of the HKSAR Government, said, “I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to our Nation on the successful landing of the Nation’s first Mars exploration project. Basic research is the strength of local universities, and the fact that PolyU was invited to participate in another major national space mission with its scientific research capabilities is a clear demonstration of Hong Kong’s exceptional strength in research and innovation. Hong Kong is also a place where many hidden talents emerge, forming an important force in national technological advancement. They will contribute to the Nation’s ‘Megascience’ projects with their expertise. I hope that local universities take advantage of research collaboration opportunities with institutions in the Mainland to create synergies that bring about complementary advantages.”\nProfessor Jin-Guang TENG, PolyU’s President, said, “We sincerely thank our Nation for trusting PolyU and inviting two of our Professors to participate in this national Mars exploration project. We are proud to have the opportunity to once again contribute to a major national aerospace technology mission. Leveraging the achievements of PolyU in the field of aerospace technology, we have decided to increase our support in this area by establishing the University Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations led by Professor Yung Kai-leung. We aim to pool together experts in different fields such as Geology, Architecture, Machinery, Physics, and Remote Sensing to conduct in-depth research in different aspects of aerospace technology. We truly hope that the mission of Tianwen-1 will be a great success and that the world will learn more about the Red Planet.”\nMars landing site mapping and evaluation\nLanding on Mars is a challenging endeavour due to several reasons, such as the complicated Martian surface, the very thin atmosphere as well as possible dust storms. There is also a 5-20 minutes time delay between Mars and Earth communications. It is therefore of paramount importance to select a landing site that is safe and of scientific significance.\nFrom 2017-2020, upon invitation by CAST, Professor WU Bo from PolyU’s Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics led a team to carry out global-scale analysis and evaluation to help shortlist three candidate landing regions, namely the Amazonis Planitia, Chryse Planitia, and Utopia Planitia, that are all located within a latitude ranging from 5° - 30°N on Mars. These regions have adequate solar illumination for optimised power generation and moderate temperature, lower elevation for longer deceleration time, and a flat terrain surface for safe landing.\nThe team further conducted detailed topographic and geomorphological mapping and analysis of the candidate landing regions, including their elevations, slopes, rock abundances, crater densities, and geological contexts. As a result of the evaluation, a region in the southern Utopia Planitia, the largest recognised impact basin in the northern hemisphere of Mars, was selected as the target landing region. Some features in the Utopia Basin like extensive sedimentary materials on the surface have been interpreted as morphological indicators of potential water-ice underneath, which are of great scientific interest since they may offer new insights into the existence of life on Mars and the evolutionary history of the Red Planet.\nSince entering the orbit of Mars on 10 February 2021, the Tianwen-1 probe has collected and sent back a large quantity of sub-meter-resolution images of the target landing region covering an area of about 70km × 180km, which is about 11 times larger than the size of Hong Kong’s territory. Using the high-resolution images from Tianwen-1, Professor Wu and his team generated high-resolution and high-precision 3D digital topographic models of the target landing region using the self-developed integrated 3D mapping model, to analyse the detailed topography and identify large slopes hazardous for landing.\nTo facilitate safe landing and roving on Mars, Professor Wu’s team also developed AI-based techniques for more automated and robust analysis of geomorphological features like craters and rocks from the high-resolution images in a short period of time. Professor Wu said, “With the aid of the AI-based techniques, we analysed over 670,000 craters, over two million rocks, and hundreds of volcanic cones distributed over the target landing region in 1.5 months. We achieved much higher efficiency in the automatic extraction of rocks and craters with about 85% correctness.” From the topographic and geomorphological mapping results, the team successfully identified several landing ellipses for the mission management team to finalise the landing site.\nProfessor Wu felt very honoured to be able to participate in and contribute to the Nation’s Mars exploration project. He said, “The Tianwen-1 mission is a mega project, and we are only a small part of an effort of thousands of people, to support the accomplishments of the mission. All of my team members were fully dedicated to the undertaking over the past months. I am thankful to them for working around the clock to get the task completed on time, yet without comprising accuracy and details.”\nMars Landing Surveillance Camera (Mars Camera)\nWith a wealth of experience in developing sophisticated space instruments, Professor Yung Kai-leung, PolyU’s Sir Sze-yuen Chung Professor in Precision Engineering, Chair Professor of Precision Engineering and Associate Head of Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has led a team to undertake the research, design and manufacturing of the Mars Camera since 2017. Thanks to their dedication and perseverance, as well as the support of the University, the team successfully completed and delivered the Mars Camera with the corresponding space qualification experiments in less than three years.\nThe PolyU-developed Mars Camera is located on the outside top surface of the lander platform, for monitoring the landing status, the surrounding environment of Mars and the movements of the Zhurong rover with respect to the unfolding and status of the solar panels and antennae. This information is critical for the successful movement of the Mars rover on the surface of Mars.\nThe Mars Camera is light in weight (around 390g), yet strong and durable enough to withstand the extreme temperature differences of about 150 degrees Celsius experienced during the nine-month journey between Earth and Mars, followed by immediate operation under the extremely low temperatures on the surface of Mars. As the Mars Camera is designed for the lander, it also has to withstand huge impact shocks of 6,200G (i.e. 6,200 times the force of Earth’s gravity). Despite having a wide-angle field of view (a maximum of 120 degrees horizontally and a maximum of 170 degrees diagonal), the Mars Camera has low image distortion.\nProfessor Yung explained, “To capture ultra-wide angle images on Mars for scientific research, the Mars Camera has to have a wide field of vision with low distortion optics within the little allowable payload, but at the same time must also be able to withstand extreme temperature variation, high radiation, mechanical impact and vibration within the little available mass, whereas maintaining high reliability under the extreme space travel environment such as high radiation.”\nProfessor Yung further shared that he was relieved that the PolyU-developed Mars Camera survived the Earth to Mars journey, “It was a real thrill when we learned that Tianwen-1 successfully touched down onto the Martian surface. A photo recently released by the China National Space Administration shows our Mars Camera on the Red Planet, and I am particularly excited to observe from the photo that our Camera remains intact. I look forward to seeing our Mars Camera capturing the spectacular views of Mars and providing images of the unfolding and movement of the Zhurong rover.”\n香港理工大學(理大)兩支跨學科研究團隊為國家近日首個火星探測項目「天問一號」作出貢獻。理大的科研人員憑藉多年來在航太科研領域所累積的豐富經驗，及卓越的研發成果，與中國空間技術研究院合作，在「天問一號」任務中發揮重要作用。當中吳波教授團隊研發創新的地形測量及地貌分析方法，協助選取火星著陸點。容啟亮教授的團隊則研發出精密的太空儀器「落火狀態監視相機」（「火星相機」），拍攝火星的周遭環境及火星車的狀況。\n「天問一號」探測器由環繞器、著陸器和巡視器 (又名「祝融」火星車) 組成，目標是一次過完成「繞、落、巡」(即「環繞」、「著陸」和「巡視」)三大工作，是世界航天史上的首次嘗試；這次任務旨在獲取有關火星的科學勘探數據。目前，「天問一號」已完成火星軌道環繞及著陸預選著陸區烏托邦平原，「祝融」火星車正侍機展開巡視及勘探工作。\n理大校董會主席林大輝博士祝賀「天問一號」成功著陸火星，他表示︰「國家在深空探測的成績令人振奮，過去在月球探索及採月壤帶回地球的任務，均取得圓滿成功；今次國家的航天任務更跨越星際，首次探索火星，進一步印證中國的航天實力。理大的科研人員有份參與火星任務，並發揮關鍵作用，令我們十分鼓舞。理大科學家將繼續以非凡的創造力、毅力和創新思維，在不同領域上參與科研，冀為人類的福祉貢獻己力。」\n香港特別行政區創新及科技局局長薛永恒先生表示: 「我衷心恭賀國家首次火星探測任務成功著陸。基礎研究是本地大學的強項，今次理大以其科創實力，再次獲邀參與國家重要航天任務，充分顯示香港科研實力雄厚，臥虎藏龍，是國家科技建設的一支重要力量，可為國家級的『大科學』項目作出貢獻。我深信本地大學亦可藉著與內地機構的科研協作，發揮協同效應，優勢互補。」\n理大校長滕錦光教授說︰「我們衷心感謝國家對理大的信任，邀請兩位教授參與國家的火星探測任務。理大有機會再次為國家的重大航天科技項目做貢獻，我們深感自豪。基於理大在航天科技領域已經取得的成績，我們決定加大對該領域的支持力度。最近，理大已成立由容啟亮教授領導的『深空探測研究中心』，聚集地質學、土木工程、機械過程、物理學等不同領域的專家，在航天科技的不同方向展開深入研究。我們衷心祝願『天問一號』任務取得圓滿成功，讓世界對這個『紅色星球』有更加多的瞭解。」\n火星著陸區測量和評估\n登陸火星是一項極具挑戰性的任務。火星表面的地形複雜，大氣層稀薄，而火星表面隨時可能出現的沙塵暴，加上火星與地球通訊有約5至20分鐘的延遲，凡此種種增加了登陸火星的難度。因此，選擇一個安全而具有科學價值的著陸點至關重要。\n2017至2020年期間，理大土地測量及地理資訊學系吳波教授應中國空間技術研究院的邀請，率領團隊進行火星全球的分析和評估，篩選出三個候選著陸區，分別位於亞馬遜平原、克里斯平原和烏托邦平原。這些候選著陸區均處於火星緯度5°- 30°N範圍，太陽日照充足，有助太陽能電池板供電，温度適中；且位處低海拔，可以延長探測器降落時減速的時間；地形平坦，有利探測器安全著陸。\n理大團隊進一步對候選著陸區進行了詳細的地形及地貌特徵分析，包括其海拔、坡度、岩石密度、撞擊坑密度，以及該區域的地質歷史。綜合研究結果，火星北半球最大的撞擊盆地烏托邦平原南部區域獲選為「天問一號」的目標著陸區。烏托邦平原的某些特徵，如其表面上廣泛存在的沉積物，顯示這個區域地下可能存在水冰，因此其科學意義重大，有助找出火星是否曾有生命的線索，了解火星的演化歷史。\n「天問一號」自2021年2月10日進入環火軌道後，已收集並傳回大量覆蓋目標著陸區的亞米級高解像度圖像回地球。是次任務的目標著陸區面積達70公里 x 180公里，即比整個香港的面積大11倍。吳波教授及其團隊利用自行研發的「三維集成測量模型」，將「天問一號」傳回的高解像度圖像，製成高精確度、高解像度的三維數碼地形模型，以詳細分析地形特徵，識別可能影響著陸安全的大型斜坡。\n為了幫助「天問一號」在火星上安全著陸和巡視，吳波教授及其團隊亦研發出「基於人工智能的撞擊坑、石塊提取方法」，在短時間內從高解像度的圖像上自動提取撞擊坑和石塊等地貌特徵，以作更精確的分析。吳教授說：「我們利用這項人工智能技術，在一個半月內分析了分佈在目標著陸區內的67萬個隕石坑、逾200多萬塊岩石，和數百個火山錐，效率超卓，準確率達到了85%。」團隊根據地形和地貌的詳細測量結果，成功搜索出數個可能的著陸點，供「天問一號」任務的管理團隊作最終抉擇。\n吳教授十分榮幸能夠參與國家的火星探測任務，並貢獻力量。他說：「『天問一號』火星探測任務是一個龐大的工程，是成千上萬人的努力成果，我們只是當中的一顆『螺絲釘』。過去幾個月，我的每一位團隊成員為這個項目全力以赴，日以繼夜工作，精益求精，沒有因為時間緊迫而對準確度和工作中的細節讓步，最終我們在限時內完成任務。」\n「落火狀態監視相機」（「火星相機」）\n理大工業及系統工程學系鍾士元爵士精密工程教授、精密工程講座教授及副系主任容啓亮教授研發精密太空儀器的經驗豐富。容教授自2017年起率領團隊，就「火星相機」進行研究、設計及製造。有賴整個團隊努力不懈，以及大學的支持，理大團隊在不到三年內，成功研製並交付火星相機，並通過多項相關的太空驗證。\n理大的「火星相機」搭載於著陸器外層平台上，以監視著陸情況、火星的周遭環境，以及降落火星後巡視器「祝融」的操作狀態，包括太陽翼的打開及天線的狀況。這些資訊對掌握巡視器能否在火星表面成功巡視至關重要。\n「火星相機」重量輕巧（約390克），然而外殼十分堅固，以抵受穿梭地球與火星超過九個月的旅程期間出現約攝氏150度的極端溫差，及後須能在火星表面極低溫的環境下運作，並要承受相等於地球地心吸力6,200倍的衝擊。此外，「火星相機」須具備廣闊測量視野（水平視野範圍達到120度，對角線視野範圍達到170度），同時顯著減低圖像變形的程度。\n容教授解釋︰「為了拍攝超廣闊的圖像及影片作科學研究之用，火星相機須輕巧並具備廣角拍攝及可控的影像變形，同時要在有限的重量內能抵受極大的衝擊力。此外，相機須在長時間的太空旅程中克服極端溫差、輻射、機械振動等挑戰，最後仍保持十分高的穩定性。」\n容教授對於理大研發的「火星相機」能在地球前往火星的長途旅程中保持完好，感到如釋重負。「得悉天問一號成功著陸火星，我和我的團隊非常興奮。從國家航天局日前公布的圖片中，我很高興看到我們的『火星相機』狀態良好。期待理大的火星相機拍攝到火星的壯麗景色以及火星車打開及運行的情況。」\n[From PolyU Media Release]",

  "text": "In support of the Nation’s first lunar sample return mission, a research team at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) developed and manufactured one of the key systems for this historic undertaking, namely the “Surface Sampling and Packing System”, in collaboration with the China Academy of Space Technology. The PolyU-developed system accomplished the tasks of automatic sample collection and packaging on the lunar surface following the soft landing of the Chang’e 5 probe on 1 December 2020. The vehicle carrying the samples is currently on course back to Earth, and is expected to touch down in China’s Inner Mongolia region next week.\nChang'e-5 is the world’s first lunar-sample return mission in more than 40 years, aiming to bring back a large amount of lunar samples of up to two kilograms via robotic means. The probe adopts two methods of moon surface sampling: one uses a robotic arm for multiple-point surface sample collections, and the other is to drill underground. The team led by Professor YUNG Kai-leung, Sir Sze-yuen Chung Professor in Precision Engineering, Chair Professor of Precision Engineering and Associate Head of Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, PolyU, was tasked in 2011 to develop the “Surface Sampling and Packing System”, a comprehensive system for lunar surface sampling, packaging and sealing.\nDr LAM Tai-fai, Chairman of Council, PolyU, remarked, “The collection of lunar samples is a landmark occasion in the history of our Nation’s space exploration programme. It is a great testament to our University’s cutting-edge research capability that PolyU was the only tertiary institution in Hong Kong to contribute to the Chang'e 5 mission. Furthermore, the fact that Hong Kong-based scientists at PolyU developed some of the most critical components for the project is a fantastic accomplishment for the whole city, proving that Hong Kong can play an important role in supporting our Nation in making significant strides in the fields of space exploration and science.”\nMr Alfred SIT, Secretary for Innovation and Technology of the HKSAR Government, said, “Over the years, PolyU has actively participated in our Nation's space exploration projects by developing highly sophisticated space instruments for our country. In the Chang'e 5 lunar exploration project, PolyU fully demonstrated its rich experience accumulated in national and international space projects, its cutting-edge technology as well as its innovative thinking. PolyU's efforts in research are in line with and complementary to the Government's goal of developing Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology hub.”\nProfessor Jin-Guang TENG, PolyU President, said, “The Chang'e 5 lunar mission has been watched closely by the entire world, since it will help the scientific community uncover some of the Moon’s secrets and mysteries. I am immensely proud that PolyU researchers developed the pioneering ‘Surface Sampling and Packing System’ to facilitate the success of this milestone mission. By contributing to such a sophisticated national space project, the University has demonstrated its substantial research competence and commitment to producing breakthrough solutions that push forward the frontiers of technology and science. PolyU will continue to devote itself to the pursuit of research excellence and the creation of innovations that benefit Hong Kong, the Nation and our world.”\nProfessor Yung expressed the pride he and his team felt to be part of this ground-breaking accomplishment. He said, “Collecting a large amount of lunar samples via robotic means was unprecedented. From research, through design to manufacturing, the development of this system has required a very high level of innovation, precision and reliability. A small glitch anywhere in the complex chain of necessary tasks could have instantly negated all the costly efforts made by those involved in the mission. Thanks to the support of the Nation, the University and the experts at PolyU Industrial Centre, we were able to produce this cutting-edge space-qualified instrument that has successfully acquired samples from the lunar surface. We are indebted to the Nation in entrusting such a critical responsibility to PolyU.”\nConsisting of two samplers for collecting loose and sticky forms of lunar regolith, two near-field cameras, as well as a packaging and sealing system, the “Surface Sampling and Packing System” has more than 400 components constructed in different materials including titanium alloy, aluminum alloy and stainless steel, which make the instruments light in weight but at the same time durable and strong enough to withstand the harsh space environment.\nTalking about the challenges of the project, Professor Yung said, “As our system needed to operate on the sun-facing side of the Moon where the ground temperatures could be as high as 110 degree Celsius, this innovation had to be highly sophisticated and capable of functioning under extremely high temperatures. It also needed to withstand the extreme space environment during travel to and landing on the Moon which meant enduring impact and shock during lift-offs and landings, high vacuum on the moon, exposure to solar wind and cosmic rays, as well as high-speed re-entry to Earth’s atmosphere.”\n“To meet the limited payload requirement, we had to be innovative in our mechanism design and be stringent in weight control. For example, the two samplers are more than a tool to acquire lunar regolith. They are also used to pick up and move the sample container from the lander to the ascender atop,” Professor Yung continued.\nFeatures of the Surface Sampling and Packing System:\nSampler A – Around 35 cm in length, Sampler A, in the shape of a shovel, is specifically engineered for collecting loose regolith. The vibration and impact during the closing of the sampler is an elaborate design to dislodge excessive debris, chisel away large pieces of regolith, tightly enclose the samples and precisely deposit the selected samples into the container without contaminating the surrounding.\nSampler B – Around 30 cm in length, Sampler B is used for collecting sticky samples by coring into the ground with teeth-like metal flaps when opened. It captures the targeted samples through the closing of these metal flaps. The piston inside the sampler pushes the sticky samples into the container during depositing of the sample when the flaps gradually open.\nNear-field Cameras – Heat resistant up to 130 degree Celsius, a near-field camera is attached to each sampler. This camera provides a monitoring and vision guidance function to help select scientifically valuable lunar samples. The vision guidance function also enables the sampler to deposit the samples into the container, grip the container and transfer it into the ascender precisely.\nSealing and Packaging System – Weighing 1.5 kilograms, of which the sample container weighs only 360 grams and is used to seal and store the lunar samples for returning to Earth, this system includes deployment of a funnel to protect the sample container from contamination when the lunar regolith is deposited and a sweeping action to brush away excessive sample to ensure the container lid can be closed properly.\nBeing the only tertiary institution in Hong Kong that possesses international deep space qualification experience, PolyU has been contributing to the Nation’s space projects since 2010. As part of the Nation’s lunar exploration programme, Professor Yung collaborated with the China Academy of Space Technology to develop a “Camera Pointing System” for Chang’e 3 in 2013 and for Chang’e 4’s historic landing on the lunar far side in 2019, and a Mars Camera for Tianwen 1 in 2020. The “Surface Sampling and Packing System” will be used for the Chang’e 6 mission as well.\nPolyU has actively participated in other space exploration projects, designing and manufacturing a number of sophisticated space tools in the past decade. These include the “Mars Rock Corer” for the European Space Agency’s 2003 Mars Express Mission and the “Soil Preparation System” for the Sino-Russian Space Mission in 2011.\n為支持國家首次月球採樣返回任務，香港理工大學（理大）科研團隊與中國空間技術研究院合作為這項歷史性任務研製了一套關鍵儀器「表取採樣執行裝置」。該裝置已於12月1日隨嫦娥五號成功於月面軟著陸，並完成了全自動的表土採樣及封裝任務。載有月壤樣本的飛行器目前正返回地球，預計下周在中國內蒙古地區降落。\n嫦娥五號是人類四十多年來首個在月球表面採集樣本的探測器，這次任務旨在於月球表面進行全自動採樣，將多達兩公斤的月球樣本帶回地球。嫦娥五號探測器以「表取採樣」（即利用機械臂在月面進行多點採樣）和「鑽取採樣」兩種方式取得月壤。針對「表取採樣」的方式，理大工業及系統工程學系鍾士元爵士精密工程教授、精密工程講座教授及副系主任容啓亮教授於2011年開始率領團隊研發一套精密的「表取採樣執行裝置」，用以進行月面採樣及封裝。\n理大校董會主席林大輝博士表示：「採集月球樣本是國家太空探索歷史上的一個重要里程碑。而理大是香港唯一有份參與嫦娥五號任務的高等院校，這充分印證了我們擁有頂尖的科研實力。再者，理大科研人員代表著香港成功為月球採樣任務研製關鍵的太空儀器，為香港爭光之餘，亦足證香港有能力在國家太空探索及科研發展上擔當重要角色。」\n香港特區政府創新及科技局局長薛永恒先生表示：「多年來，理大積極參與國家的太空探索項目，為國家研製高度精密的太空儀器。在這次嫦娥五號探月工程中，理大充分展示科研團隊過去多年來在國內外航天項目中所累積的豐富經驗、努力研發的高端技術，以及力求創新的思維。理大在科研方面所作出的努力，與特區政府銳意發展香港成為國際創新科技中心的目標，相輔相成。」\n理大校長滕錦光教授說：「嫦娥五號的採樣返回任務有助科學界發現更多月球的奧秘，因此備受世界注目。理大科研人員研製的『表取採樣執行裝置』協助嫦五任務取得成功，我為此感到非常榮幸。藉著參與這項複雜艱巨的太空任務，理大科研團隊展示了其堅實的科研能力及銳意創新的精神，推動前沿技術及科學領域的發展。理大將繼續在科研領域追求卓越、引領創新，積極為香港、國家以至世界作出貢獻。」\n對於獲邀參與這次具開創性意義的太空任務，容教授及其團隊深感榮幸。他說：「透過全自動機械臂採集如此大量的月球樣本是史無前例的。這個項目由前期研發、裝置設計到儀器製造，均需要我們的團隊在創新性、精確度和可靠性等方面達到極高水平。由於這次任務十分複雜，環環相扣，任何細節只要出現微細錯誤，便會令之前所付出的努力全部白費。我們衷心感謝國家、大學，以及理大工業中心專家團隊的支持，讓我們成功研製出這套通過太空驗證的儀器，並順利完成採集表土樣本。我們十分感激國家授予這項關鍵的裝置研發任務。」\n理大製造的「表取採樣執行裝置」正樣部分包含兩個採樣器，分別用作採集鬆散及黏性樣本；兩個近攝相機；並配備一套「初級裝封系統」用於以密封並保存樣本於樣本容器中。整套「表取採樣執行裝置」由超過400件工件組合而成，由不同材料如鈦合金、鋁合金及不鏽鋼等所製造，減低整個裝置的重量，同時堅硬耐磨，以抵受嚴峻的太空環境。\n談及研發過程所遇到的挑戰，容教授說：「由於『表取採樣執行裝置』在面向太陽的一方運作，月面溫度可高達攝氏110度。我們設計這套創新的系統時必須考慮周詳，以便能夠在極高溫下運作，並須抵受太空穿梭期間及月面的極端環境︰包括升空及著陸時的衝擊及震盪、月球的真空環境、太陽風及宇宙射線，並確保在高速穿越地球大氣層時，樣本仍然保持穩定。」\n「為達到載荷重量的要求，我們必須在機械設計方面力求創新，嚴格控制整個裝置的重量。以兩個採樣器為例，它們不僅可用於採集樣本，同時具有將樣品容器鉗起的功能，將其從著陸器移到上升器上。」容教授續說。\n「表取採樣執行裝置」特點：\n採樣器(甲) – 採樣器(甲)的長度約為35厘米，其鏟子形狀專為採集鬆散的月球樣本而設。當採樣器閉合時會產生震動及衝擊，這個精心設計能甩走多餘的碎片、鑿開大塊的月壤，並將月壤樣本裹於採樣器內，同時有助將樣本準確地倒入樣本罐中，以免弄污周遭儀器。\n採樣器(乙) – 採樣器(乙)的長度約為30厘米，用於採集黏性月球表層樣本。採樣器會鑽進月壤，透過打開齒狀金屬瓣抓取黏性樣本，當金屬瓣閉合時即可抓緊目標樣本。隨著金屬瓣慢慢張開，採樣器內的活塞會將黏性樣本推進樣本罐內。\n近攝相機 – 可抵受高達攝氏130度的高溫。每個採樣器均配有一台近攝相機，可在樣本採集過程中發揮監察和視像導航功能，有助揀選具科研價值的月壤樣本，將樣本準確地倒進樣本罐內及準確地提罐放到上升器內。\n初級封裝系統 –整個系統重約1.5公斤，而樣本罐只佔360克，用於將月球樣本密封保存，以帶回地球。此系統有多項匠心設計，包括透過漏斗將樣本倒入樣本罐內，期間不會弄污罐身；另外，鎖罐前會掃走溢出罐口的月壤，確保罐蓋能妥善關好，以將罐內的樣本密封鎖緊。\n理大是香港唯一擁有國際太空任務實戰經驗的高等院校，自2010年起在國家的太空探究項目方面一直不遺餘力。為支持國家的探月工程，容教授多年來與中國空間技術研究院的專家攜手研製出多項太空儀器，包括應用於2013年嫦娥三號及2019年嫦娥四號的月背探測任務的「相機指向機構系統」，以及2020年應用於天問一號的「落火狀態監視相機」。理大團隊的「表取採樣執行裝置」亦將應用於嫦娥六號探月任務。\n理大多年來積極參與不同的太空探索項目，研製各項先進的太空儀器，包括為歐洲太空總署2003年火星快車任務研發「岩芯取樣器」，以及為2011年的中俄聯合探索火星任務研發「行星表土準備系統」。\n[From PolyU Media Release]\nMedia Coverage\nMing Pao Daily News - https://bit.ly/2JLwdvW\nNowTV - https://bit.ly/33S2xnR\nTVB - https://bit.ly/2K5NhfM\nSing Tao Daily - https://bit.ly/2Lkt72s\nOriental Daily News - https://bit.ly/3qIhYsC\nHong Kong Economic Times - https://bit.ly/3qC6mal\nWen Wei Po - https://bit.ly/3m6s96N\nTa Kung Pao - https://bit.ly/2VRlxyg\nHong Kong Commercial Daily - https://bit.ly/3qDAkuM\nYahoo - https://bit.ly/2Le0WC9\nSina - https://bit.ly/39TFhtl",

  "text": "Project:\nNovel High Efficacy Nano Multi-ring Defocus Incorporated Spectacle Lens for Myopia Control\nAwards:\nPrize of the State of Geneva\nGold Medal with Congratulations of the Jury\nPrincipal Investigators: \nProf. Benny CHEUNG Chi-fai\nChair Professor of Ultra-precision Machining and Metrology, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Director of State Key Laboratory of Ultra-precision Machining Technology\nProf. TO Chi-ho\nVisiting Chair Professor of Experimental Optometry, School of Optometry\nMr Jackson LEUNG Tze-man\nCo-founder, Vision Science & Technology Co Ltd (a PolyU Academic-led startup)\nDetails:\n\nThe novel Nano Multi-ring Defocus Incorporated Spectacle (NMDIS) lens is an advanced spectacle lens designed to slow the progression of myopia in children. The NMDIS lens combines two cutting-edge technologies – the Defocus Incorporated Soft Contact (DISC) lens and Ultra-precision Nano Multi-ring Machining Technology (UPNMMT) – to produce high-quality lenses.The NMDIS lens features annular spaced correction zones and defocus zones. The correction zones function as a regular concave lens to correct vision at the centre of the retina, while the defocus zones focus light slightly in front of the retina to achieve myopia defocus. This effectively inhibits elongation of the eyeball, slowing the progression of myopia.UPNMMT enables the precision moulding of NMDIS lenses by fabricating the unique tangential continuity nano multi-ring structure on the moulds. By optimising the width and height of the defocus zones, it enables a reasonable distribution of optical power to generate a smooth and seamless lens surface, and strikes a good balance between clear vision, comfort, and myopia control for children.\nProject:\nMars Landing Surveillance Camera for Tianwen-1 Mars Soft Landing Mission\nAwards:\nPrize by the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca Romania\nGold Medal with Congratulations of the Jury\nPrincipal Investigator: \nProf. YUNG Kai-leung\nSir Sze-yuen Chung Professor in Precision Engineering, Director of Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations, Chair Professor of Precision Engineering and Associate Head, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, PolyU\nDetails:\n\nThis is a space qualified camera designed for use on Mars. The camera has a wide temperature range, low distortion, an ultra-wide 170-degree diagonal field of view, and can withstand 6200g of shock, making it suitable for use in the harsh environment of Mars.\nDespite weighing only 390 grams, the camera features innovative design elements such as integrated thermo-dissipation and layered metallic radiation protection with a flexible shock absorbing structure.\nThe camera successfully landed on Mars in 2021 on board the landing platform of Tianwen-1 lander.

  "text": "We are pleased to report that our Department has educated more than 11,000 graduates up to 2020, many of whom are holding very senior positions in industry - not only as manufacturing, production and industrial engineers but also in a variety of industries that support both the manufacturing and service sectors. We are proud to mention that thirteen graduates of the Department had been granted Outstanding PolyU Alumni Awards; this is the second highest number in the University.\nWith regard to research, the Department continuously aligns its research direction with the changing industrial vista of Hong Kong and the region. Over the last ten to twenty years, the profile of the Department has completely changed from one that was largely confined to serving the manufacturing industry to one that is now much broader in its scope, covering both manufacturing and the service sectors. We also believe that it is vital to be at the forefront of research for developing relevant academic programmes, particularly at the postgraduate level.\nOur research strategy focuses on both fundamental and applied research, with emphasis on technology transfer and service to industry and the community, particularly in the areas of advanced manufacturing technology, engineering management and logistics, and smart systems and design. We are particularly strong in applied research. In fact, the Department has achieved the highest number of Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) projects among all industrial/manufacturing engineering Departments in Hong Kong universities for many years. \nThe Department established the Centre for Advances in Reliability and Safety at the HK Science and Technology Parks in 2020 to help HK advance in the areas of Product Safety and System Reliability. In ultra-precision machining and precision metrology research, we obtained a European Commission (EC) / Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) Collaboration Project on diamond cutting of hierarchical optical surfaces under an EC Horizon 2020 programme for the mass production of functional structured surfaces. We also participated in a European Metrology Programme for an Innovation and Research (EMPIR) project on reference algorithms for measuring aspherical and freeform lenses.\nOur Knowledge Management Team supports knowledge transfer and innovation management. In this area, we have served many government departments such as Correctional Services, Social Welfare, and Department of Health, and major corporations such as MTR and CLP Power Hong Kong Limited. The Centre is also supporting and coordinating the Global Most Innovative Knowledge Enterprise (MIKE) Award and Study Group in enterprise innovation research.\nThe Department has also collaborated with the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) in successfully developing a Surveillance Camera for China’s first Mars Landing Mission and in further developing proposals for China’s future Key State Deep Space Exploration Programmes, such as the Mars Sample Return Mission and Asteroid Sample Return Mission.\nOur research is multi-disciplinary and we have a wide variety of partners for our collaborative projects. Our academic programmes are well founded and supported by our research strength.",

The competition is co-organized by the University Alliance of the Silk Road (UASR), the National Innovation Institute of Additive Manufacturing (NIIAM, China), and the Université de Technologie de Belfort Montbéliard (UTBM, France).\nMr Xie’s award winning project is titled “Novel Bioresorbable Mg-based alloys for patient-specific implants using laser additive manufacturing”.\nProject Description:\nThe currently used materials for bone plates and screws for bone fracture healing are Ti alloys and stainless steel, which require secondary surgery to remove the implant after bone recovery. However, such secondary removal surgery puts pressure on the body, causes pain, risk, inconvenience, hospitalization and additional costs and it adds to the problem of the shortage of hospital beds especially during COVID-19. A step change is in applying novel bioresorbable Mg alloys, which are designed to be fully degraded in the human body after bone recovery and therefore removing the need for secondary surgery.\nThe project has successfully applied laser additive manufacturing to fabricate high aspect-ratio Mg alloys parts. Such high aspect-ratio parts are difficult to additively manufacture due to the heat accumulation although they have a more similar shape to actual bone plates. The project has also applies a support structure to minimize the deformation, which is a major change from research to practical applications.",

  "text": "Organiser\nDepartment of Industrial and Systems Engineering, PolyU; Research Institute for Advanced Manufacturing (RIAM)\nSpeaker\nProf. Adisa Azapagic\nMeeting link will be sent to successful registrants\nSummary\nThe concept of circular economy has emerged in response to the need for decoupling the economic growth from resource consumption and environmental impacts. Aiming to maximise resource efficiency, it represents an alternative to the current linear ‘take-make-use-dispose’ economic model. The circular economy concept rests on three fundamental principles: i) preserving and enhancing natural capital; i) circulating products and materials at the highest utility as long as possible; and iii) designing out negative externalities. Therefore, transitioning to a circular economy will require a systemic change across supply chains, involving both technological and business model innovations. This in turn will necessitate a whole systems approach and life cycle thinking to capture and address the complex interrelationships between different aspects of a circular economy. One of the complexities is that ‘circular’ does not necessarily mean ‘sustainable’. Hence, we need to be able to understand the full implications of a switch from the ‘linear’ to ‘circular’ economic models. Focusing on environmental impacts of that switch, this presentation will discuss how we can measure the ‘circularity’ on a life cycle basis and what that may mean in practice, considering examples in the food, energy and chemical sectors.\nKeynote Speaker\nProf. Adisa Azapagic\nProfessor of Sustainable Chemical Engineering \nDepartment of Chemical Engineering\nThe University of Manchester, UK.\nAdisa Azapagic is a Professor of Sustainable Chemical Engineering at the University of Manchester, where she leads Sustainable Industrial Systems, a multidisciplinary research group working with industry, policy makers and other stakeholders on identifying sustainable solutions to current sustainability challenges.

  "text": "Meeting Link will be sent to successful registrants\nLIBs have flourished for 30 years with the energy density tripled since the 1990s thanks to the coupling of layered cathodes, graphite, and carbonate electrolytes. To further promote the energy density of LIBs, the most promising strategies are to enhance the cut-off voltage of the prevailing cathodes or explore novel high-capacity and high-voltage cathode materials, and also replace graphite anode with Si/Si-C or Li metal for anodes. However, the commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolytes with relatively low anodic stability of ~ 4.3 V vs. Li+/Li cannot sustain high-voltage cathodes. Bottleneck restricting the electrochemical performance in Li batteries has been veered to the new electrolyte compositions catered for aggressive next-generation cathodes and Si/Si-C or Li metal anodes, since the oxidation-resistance of the electrolytes and the in situ formed cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers at the high-voltage cathodes and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on anodes critically control the electrochemical performance of these high-voltage Li batteries. In this seminar, I will present a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the recent advances, fundamental mechanisms, scientific challenges, and design strategies for the novel high-voltage electrolyte systems, especially focused on stability issues of the electrolytes, the compatibility and interactions between the electrolytes and the electrodes, and reaction mechanisms.\nProf. Xiulin Fan\nState Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials \nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering \nZhejiang University, China.\nDr Fan received his bachelor’s and PhD degrees from Zhejiang University in 2007 and 2012 respectively.

  "text": "Speaker\nProf. Xiaopeng Li\nMeeting link will be sent to successful registrants\nAutomated vehicle (AV) following control impacts traffic safety, mobility and stability. Our empirical study showed that commercial AV following control became more unstable as the headway was set to a smaller value, implying a possible intrinsic trade-off between safety, mobility and stability aspects in AV following control design. We further analytically explained the underlying vehicle control mechanism that dictates this trade-off. We investigated a parsimonious linear AV following model that captures the first-order parameters on the safety, mobility and stability aspects. The string stability results indicate that the minimum headway considering the safety buffer alone may be hardly achieved due to stability concerns, and practical AV control needs to either allow a longer headway to trade for string-stable traffic or conversely accommodate moderate string-instability to trade for a smaller AV following headway. These findings are verified by field experiments with production vehicles. Vehicles of different powertrains (e.g., electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engines) are compared. Methods of improving vehicle performance are explored. This work also provides a possible explanation of observed string instability of commercial AV following control (e.g., adaptive cruise control) and provides thoughts on improving existing technology and transportation systems.\nProf. Xiaopeng Li\nAssociate Professor, \nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, US\nDr Xiaopeng (Shaw) Li is currently an associate professor at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison).

Multi-axis motion introduces more degrees of freedom into the process of 3D printing to enable different objectives of fabrication by accumulating materials layers upon curved layers. An existing challenge is how to effectively generate the curved layers satisfying multiple objectives simultaneously. I will present a general slicing framework for achieving multiple fabrication objectives including support free, strength reinforcement and surface quality, which is based on computing rotation-driven deformation in an optimization framework with the help of quaternion fields. To perfectly realize computed toolpaths, motion planning for both the articulated robots and the multi-axis parallel machines are considered in our research to improve the kinematics in MAAM. Problems of jerk, singularity and collision are considered in an integrated manner to improve the motion therefore the quality of fabrication.\nProf. Charlie C. L.

  "text": "The aviation industry had been continuously growing in the last century, surviving from several major shocks, which highlights the resilience of the aviation system. It seems, however, that the aviation industry has not learned its lessons from these earlier experiences, culminating into the devastating impact on the industry by the COVID-19, with unprecedented global declines in passenger volume and airline revenue. Pending the available vaccines, governments implemented non-pharmaceutical measures to control local epidemic in early stages. It was shown that air transportation played an important role in spreading the COVID-19; as a consequence, flight bans were executed by countries and regions against the first waves of the pandemic. For instance, the greatest disconnection of the worldwide air transport since the World War II occurred in April 2020, when passenger traffic was reduced by 94% compared to 2019, and total operating revenues for the industry were down by 62% in 2020. These last three years with the pandemic have highlighted the vulnerability of our aviation system and the society as a whole. Accordingly, it is instrumental to better understand the mechanisms and ramifications of COVID-19 for preparing towards future external disruptions. In this seminar, I will discuss the interactions between the pandemic and aviation at the world level. Our data-driven analysis is divided into three stages based on the major periods of COVID-19, namely, March 2020-June 2020, July 2020-June 2021, and the endemic recovery from July 2021 to June 2022. The policy and managerial implications for post-recovery period and Chinese aviation industry will be examined, and the recommendations for future research work will be provided.",

All submissions went through a rigorous review process and each paper was reviewed by numerous of committee members.\nThe paper analyzed the impact of overconfidence in centralized dual-channel supply chain and modelled consumers who are overprecise in product valuation. The results showed that consumer overconfidence is not necessarily a negative force on customers. The higher the consumers’ overconfidence level, the lower the prices offered to them. However, consumers’ overconfidence leads to losses for the manufacturer. And the dual- channel strategy can be an effective tool for the manufacturer to reduce the negative effect of consumer overconfidence. The work is inspiring that the outcome is awarded at the conference.\nThe conference was hosted by Haier Group and co-organized by the Association of Supply Chain and Operation Management (ASCOM) and China Europe International Business School (CEIBS), from 12-15 July 2018 in Qingdao.",

  "text": "A research team of State Key Laboratory of Ultra-precision Machining Technology (Partner Laboratory in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University) and PolyU students has successfully developed the most energy-efficient Light Emitting Diode (LED) filament technology with a luminous efficacy of 129lm/W, which represents 1.5 times the efficacy of traditional LED lamps, surpassing all other general lighting tools available in the market. In 2015, PolyU Micro Fund awarded a seed fund of HK$100,000[1] to the student team and it is expected that the product can be launched this year.\nThis LED filament technology has excellent energy efficiency. Based on the assumption of a daily operation of eight hours, a PolyU's LED filament bulb with lumen of 1300lm costs HK$33[2] of electricity tariff per year, and contributes to 22kg of carbon dioxide emission yearly. In comparison, a traditional LED lamp costs HK$47 of electricity tariff and 31kg of carbon dioxide emission yearly with the same lumen and conditions, which means that the new technology can reduce carbon dioxide emission by 30%. Besides, the new technology enables an expected lifetime of 50,000 hours, with only half of the production cost of traditional LED lamps.\nThanks to its energy-saving and long lifetime features, LED lighting contributes significantly to sustainable development. However, the limitations of traditional LED lamps, including high production cost and narrow beam angle have affected its popularity. The LED filament technology developed by PolyU has not only achieved breakthrough in the areas of energy efficiency, lifetime, and production cost, but it also has other advantages including:\nWide beam angle: 300-degree, parallels to that of incandescent bulb;\nComparably high colour rendering index (CRI): Enables original colour projection of objects as if they are in natural light;\nLess UV light emission; and\nMore environmental friendly: Absence of harmful chemicals, and consists of less electronic components, and 80% of recyclable materials.\nThese breakthroughs are made possible by the following technology advancement:\nUsing Aluminium as substrate material \nLED chips are sensitive to heat. Heat diminishes its luminosity and speeds up the drop of lumen, and therefore heat flow design of substrate is crucial to the lifetime of LED lamps. Instead of ceramic and sapphires, Aluminium, with good thermal conductivity, high reflectivity and affordable price, is chosen as the substrate material, to achieve longer lifetime and higher lumen at a lower cost.\nMounting LED chips of small power on both sides of substrate \nThe larger the power (Watt) of a LED chip is, the higher the electric current it needs, leading to more energy loss. In PolyU's LED filament lamp, LED chips with large power are replaced by many tiny LED chips with small power which are mounted on both sides of the substrate. This design will reduce energy loss and generate even light diffusion, without affecting luminosity.\nApplying PolyU's advanced injection moulding technology \nHemispherical plastic case of LED lamps made with traditional plastic moulding method limits beam angle. Applying advanced injection moulding technology developed by PolyU Advanced Optics Manufacturing Centre, a seamless and transparent spherical plastic case is produced to make 300-degree beam angle possible.\nEnhancing power supply \nPolyU LED filament lamp converts AC (alternate current) to low current DC (direct current) directly without dealing with the voltage, and hence reduces components required and simplifies circuits, enhancing reliability and efficiency of the lamp.\nThe patent application of this new technology has been filed and the prototype design is completed. In future, the team will conduct various tests and obtain certifications for market launch.\nFootnotes:\n[1] The amount of seed fund offered by PolyU Micro Fund has been increased to $120,000 since 2016\n[2] HK$1.14 per kWh\n香港理工大學 (理大) 超精密加工技術國家重點實驗室與學生研究團隊成功研發市場上最省電LED (發光二極管) 燈絲技術，其發光效率達129 流明/瓦特 (lm/W)，約為傳統LED 燈的1.5倍，能源效益超越現時市場上的通用照明產品。2015年「理大微型基金」撥出十萬元[1]予該學生團隊，預期有關產品可於今年推出。\n理大研發的LED 燈絲燈技術具優越的能源效益，以每天使用8小時計算，燈絲燈泡 (光度1300流明) 一年所需電費僅為33 港元[2]，碳排放量為22 公斤CO2e。而相同光度、相同使用時間情况下，傳統LED 燈卻要耗電47港元，碳排放量為31 公斤CO2e，故可新技術可減少30% 的碳排放量。不但如此，理大LED燈絲燈預計壽命長達50,000 小時，生產成本僅為傳統LED 燈的一半。\nLED 照明產品省電長壽，對可持續發展有顯著貢獻。但是，傳統LED燈仍然存在不少缺點和局限，如生產成本高、照明角度狹窄等等，影響其市場普及。理大研發的LED燈絲技術除了在能源效益、壽命和生產成本等方面取得突破性的進展，還包括以下優點：\n照明角度廣闊─可與鎢絲燈泡一樣覆蓋300度；\n顯色指數高─接近日光的顯色指數令物件尤如呈現在自然光下；\n釋出紫外線低；及\n更加綠色環保—不含有害化學物質、所用電子零件少，可回收材料達八成。\n以上突破性進展和優點源自如下的技術創新：\n採用金屬鋁作為基底\nLED 晶片對熱力敏感，熱力會使其光度減弱及加速衰退，因此基底的散熱設計成為影響LED 燈壽命的關鍵因素。理大團隊選取具優秀散熱性能和良好光反射性、價格相宜的金屬鋁作為基底材料取代陶瓷或藍寶石，以延長壽命、增加光度，同時降低生產成本。\n將多片小功率LED晶片置於基底兩面 \n單片LED 晶片的功率越大，其所需電流量越大，能量損耗就越多。在理大LED 燈絲燈的設計中，研究人員以多片小功率的LED 晶片取代單片大功率晶片，平均置於基底的上下兩面，在輸出同等光度情況下，可以降低能量損耗，同時令光線分佈均勻。\n採用理大先進塑膠注塑成型技術 \n傳統的塑膠注塑技術只能塑造半球型燈罩，限制照明角度。理大團隊應用理大先進光學製造中心特有的先進塑膠注塑成型技術，造出無縫和高透光的塑膠近球形燈頭罩，達至300度空間照明角度。\n優化供電方法 \n理大的LED 燈絲燈將交流電直接轉換為低電流直流電，取代變換電壓的供電方式，簡化電路，減少燈絲燈所需電子零件，提升可靠性及效率。\n該技術發明專利申請已獲受理，研究團隊已經完成原型設計，未來會進行進一步的測試、申請各項產品認證及市場推廣。\n註:\n[1] 自2016年起，「理大微型基金」的資助額已提高至十二萬港元\n[2] 以每度電1.14港元計\n(Source: PolyU website)\nOnline media coverage:\nOriental Daily News - http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/news/20170309/00176_021.html \nOn.cc - https://goo.gl/39ZzHC\nSCMP - https://goo.gl/uzVuR9\nMing Pao Daily News - (1) https://goo.gl/QnEHQA (2) - https://goo.gl/zs8zc2\nCommercial Radio - https://goo.gl/whtwHV\nSing Tao Daily - https://goo.gl/y1OL0u\nam730 - https://goo.gl/hzIQmq\nHK Economic Times - https://goo.gl/uFWukv\nHK Economic Journal - https://goo.gl/pXvOnU\nTa Kung Pao - http://www.takungpao.com.hk/hongkong/text/2017/0308/65179.html\nWen Wei Po - http://paper.wenweipo.com/2017/03/09/ED1703090001.htm\nHK Commercial Daily - http://www.hkcd.com.hk/content/2017-03/08/content_3631846.htm\nYahoo HK - (1) https://goo.gl/8OUWxP (2) https://goo.gl/g0kPXr (3) https://goo.gl/RWwymS\n新華社 - http://news.xinhuanet.com/gangao/2017-03/08/c_1120591242.htm \nSina HK - https://goo.gl/ePLcvm \n新浪新聞 - http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2017-03-08/doc-ifychavf2060116.shtml\nSina.tw - http://news.sina.com.tw/article/20170308/20983052.html\nAsia Pacific Daily - http://zh.apdnews.com/XinHuaNews/603632.html\n亞太日報 - http://www.niuson.com/XinHuaNews/603632.html\n香港新聞網 - http://www.hkcna.hk/content/2017/0308/551310.shtml \n星島環球網 - http://ed-china.stnn.cc/finance/2017/0308/408328.shtml\n半導體照明網 - http://lights.ofweek.com/2017-03/ART-220001-8120-30112122.html \nBenzinga.com - https://goo.gl/acYw5p\nKuam News - https://goo.gl/QYD2B2 \n88iv - http://www.88iv.com/sc/hot_news_detail.html?id=1703090609",

  "text": "Researchers at PolyU have developed and manufactured the “Surface Sampling and Packing System”, specifically designed for Chang’e 5, the Nation’s first lunar sample return mission. Following the successful launch of Chang’e 5 by the Long March 5 rocket today (24 November), the Surface Sampling and Packing System is scheduled to commence lunar sampling in early December.\nJoining this historic mission is the team led by Professor YUNG Kai-leung, Sir Sze-yuen Chung Professor in Precision Engineering, Chair Professor of Precision Engineering and Associate Head of Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, PolyU. Dr Robert W.M. TAM, Interim Director of PolyU’s Industrial Centre, is one of the team’s key members. \nChang'e 5, the third phase of the Nation’s lunar exploration project, is China’s first space mission to collect and return two kilogram samples of lunar regolith. The Chang'e 5 spacecraft comprises four modules: an orbiter, an ascender, a lander and a return vehicle. Transported on the Chang’e 5 lander, the PolyU-developed Surface Sampling and Packing System includes two samplers that can withstand 200 °C for collecting samples of lunar regolith in loose and sticky form, two heat-resistant nearfield cameras for vision guidance during sample acquisition, and a packaging and sealing system for sealing the samples in a container. Upon completion of sample acquisition on the lunar surface by the PolyU samplers, the robot arm will, through vision guidance, lift the PolyU designed and made container and place it into the ascender. The ascender will then lift off into lunar orbit, dock with the orbiter and transfer the sample container to the return vehicle for the journey back to Earth.\n“Over the years, PolyU has been honoured to participate in the national space exploration programmes and to contribute to the development of highly sophisticated space instruments for the Nation,” said PolyU President Professor Jin-Guang TENG. “In the Chang'e 5 lunar exploration project, PolyU's research team has developed one of the key sets of sampling instruments and made a breakthrough in lunar surface sampling by leveraging its valuable experience in international space projects, its innovative thinking and its cutting-edge technology. In achieving its motto - ‘to learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind’, through rigorous scientific study and research excellence, PolyU will continue to make important contributions to Chang'e 6 and other national space missions.”\nBuilding on their previous study of the lunar environment and a wealth of experience from several lunar missions, Professor YUNG Kai-leung and his team started researching and developing the Surface Sampling and Packing System in 2011 and completed the project in 2017. Professor YUNG Kai-leung said, “The return of samples from the moon is technically complex. It takes more than six prototype productions through various stages of space qualification procedures in order to complete the project, not to mention the pre-production research, system design, discussions and meetings in collaboration with the China Academy of Space Technology.”\n“The Surface Sampling and Packing System is one of the most critical components of the Chang’e 5 mission. We are truly thankful for being entrusted with such an important and challenging task for this historic space project.” Professor YUNG said.\nIn addition to the System itself, the innovative techniques for high-precision high-resolution 3D mapping and geomorphologic analysis of the landing region developed by Professor Bo WU from PolyU’s Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics are important for characterisation of the landing region, in order to support decision-making for selecting the final landing site for Chang’e 5.\nBeing the only tertiary institution in Hong Kong that possesses international space qualification experience, PolyU has been contributing to the Nation’s space projects since 2010. As part of the Nation’s lunar exploration programme, Professor YUNG collaborated with the China Academy of Space Technology to develop a “Camera Pointing System” for Chang’e 3 in 2013 and for Chang’e 4’s historic landing on lunar far side in 2019, and a Mars Camera for Tianwen 1 in 2020. The “Surface Sampling and Packing System” will be used for the Chang’e 6 mission as well.\nPolyU has actively participated in other space exploration projects, designing and manufacturing a number of sophisticated space tools in the past decade. These include the “Mars Rock Corer” for the European Space Agency’s 2003 Mars Express Mission and the “Soil Preparation System” for the Sino-Russian Space Mission in 2011.\n由香港理工大學（理大）科研人員專為嫦娥五號研製的「表取採樣執行裝置」，將參與國家首個月球採樣返回任務。今天搭載於長征五號運載火箭的嫦娥五號已成功發射，理大的「表取採樣執行裝置」預計於12月初於月球表面展開採樣工作。\n這項歷史性的研發工作由理大工業及系統工程學系鍾士元爵士精密工程教授、精密工程講座教授及副系主任容啓亮教授率領團隊共同研發，團隊主要成員包括理大工業中心暫任總監譚惠民博士。\n嫦娥五號是中國探月工程第三階段的月球探測器，是中國首個月球採樣計劃，這次任務是要採集約兩公斤的月球表面樣本返回地球。嫦娥五號由軌道器、上升器、着陸器和返回器四個部分組成。至於理大研發及製造的「表取採樣執行裝置」，則載於嫦娥五號的着陸器上，執行裝置包含兩個可抵受攝氏200度的採樣器，用於收集鬆散和黏性兩類月球樣本；兩台高溫的近攝相機，可在樣本採集過程中發揮監察和指導功能；以及初級封裝系統，用以將樣本密封並保存於樣本容器中。在月球表面的採樣工作完成後，機械臂會透過視像引導將理大研製的樣本容器提起，並放入上升器內。隨後，上升器會離開月球表面進入月球軌道，與軌道器交合對接，並將樣本容器轉移至返回器，以便將樣本運返地球。\n理大校長滕錦光教授表示：「理大有機會長期參與國家太空探索項目，為國家研製高度精密的太空儀器作出貢獻，我們感到非常榮幸。在這次嫦娥五號探月工程中，理大的科研團隊憑借多年來在國內外航天項目中所累積的寶貴經驗，透過創新思維及採用高端技術，研製了其中一個關鍵的採樣系統，為在月球表面的採樣工作取得了突破。理大將秉持其『開物成務，勵學利民』的校訓，希望通過嚴謹、卓越的科研工作，繼續為嫦娥六號及國家其他航天任務作出重要貢獻。」\n容啓亮教授及其團隊憑藉他們對月球環境的研究基礎及多次探月任務的豐富經驗，於2011年開始着手研究和開發「表取採樣執行裝置」，並於2017年完成此項目。容啓亮教授表示：「這次的月球採樣返回任務在技術上非常複雜。團隊進行了最少六次裝置製造及交付，以通過太空儀器的驗證過程。此外，我們也與中國空間技術研究院專家保持密切溝通，在產品前期研究及系統設計上力求盡善盡美。 」\n「表取採樣執行裝置是嫦娥五號採樣返回任務的一個關鍵部分。我們很榮幸能擔此重任，在這次歷史性的航太項目中獲委以這項意義重大而極具挑戰的工作。」容教授續說。\n此外，理大土地測量及地理資訊學系吳波教授亦研發創新技術，以進行高精確度和高解像度的三維地形測繪及地貌分析，研究嫦娥五號着陸區的地形地貌特徵，協助選取嫦娥五號的着陸點。\n理大是香港唯一擁有國際太空任務實戰經驗的高等院校，自2010年起在國家的太空探究項目方面一直不遺餘力。為支持國家的探月工程，容教授多年來與中國空間技術研究院的專家攜手研製出多項太空儀器，包括應用於2013年嫦娥三號及2019年嫦娥四號的月背探測任務的「相機指向機構系統」，以及2020年應用於天問一號的「落火狀態監視相機」。理大團隊的「表取採樣執行裝置」亦將應用於嫦娥六號探月任務。\n理大多年來積極參與不同的太空探索項目，研製各項先進的太空儀器，包括為歐洲太空總署2003年火星快車任務研發「岩芯取樣器」，以及為2011年的中俄聯合探索火星任務研發「行星表土準備系統」。",

Yet traditional logistics providers, with their low-technology and labour-intensive warehouses, are also lagging behind, due to labour shortage caused by ageing population.\nThe compact and flexible Autonomous Mobile Robot, utilising QR Code navigation technologies, has a maximum loading of 500 kg. It can easily move the entire storage rack, facilitating fast picking and replenishment.\nTo cope with this challenge, a team from the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering led by Dr Carman Lee Ka-man collaborated with an industrial partner, RV Automation Technology Company Limited, to jointly develop a smart robotic warehouse management system that transforms traditional warehouses into contemporary, high-technology and unmanned logistics fulfilment centres.\nDeveloped under the funding support of the Innovation and Technology Commission, this revolutionary system combines the most advanced Industry 4.0 technologies – the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and Cloud Computing – to improve the scalability, speed and efficiency of various stages of logistics operations, including warehouse management solutions, storage lockers and express services, etc.\nThe system’s success is a shift from person-to-goods to goods-to-person in logistics operations. Workers no longer need to search for specific items to fulfil orders, as AMRs simply deliver the required goods in storage racks for fast picking and replenishment. Thanks to cutting-edge swarm robotics and optimisation algorithms, these AMRs also collaborate efficiently to fulfill a range of activities, including re-slotting, multi-deep storage and batch picking, etc.\nDr Carmen Lee (front middle) and her team\nThe practical value of this research project has already been demonstrated in the recently opened RobEx Centre, Hong Kong’s first fully automated and unmanned smart warehouse facility in Hong Kong Science Park. The smart robotics warehouse management system has been complimented for operating round-the-clock, maximising operational efficiency and reducing the need for physically demanding human labour. In addition, big data analysis helps to scale warehouse services to meet demand in peak hours and reduce human errors in parcel storage and delivery.\nIn December 2018, this project won the Gold Award and Outstanding Automation Award at the Asia International Innovative Invention Awards. The system is expected not only to enhance the development of the logistics industry – a key pillar of Hong Kong’s economy, but also to help create a safer working environment for the industry.",

  "text": "香港理工大學（理大）將與中國空間技術研究院（五院）合作，研發和生產一台可搭載於擬於最早2020年發射的火星探測系統上的「落火狀態監視相機」（「火星相機」）。雙方於今天（2018年8月22日）就火星探測項目的聯合研製協議（「聯合協議」）舉行簽署儀式。\n聯合協議的合作項目旨在支持國家的首次火星探測。據了解，火星探測器擬於2020年發射，目標是在一次任務中，對火星同時進行軌道和地面探測，這將成為全球首次相關任務。\n火星探測系統由環繞器、著陸器和巡視器組成。根據聯合協議，理大設計和生產的「火星相機」將搭載在著陸器外面頂部，用於監視降落火星後巡視器的操作狀態，包括太陽翼的打開、火星的周遭環境，以及巡視器本身的走動情況。這些資訊對掌握巡視器能否在火星表面成功巡視至關重要。\n理大副校長（科研發展）衞炳江教授與五院總經濟師周宏女士今天假理大簽署「聯合協議」，並由嘉賓見證簽署儀式。簽署儀式的見證人為：香港特區政府教育局局長楊潤雄先生、中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部李魯部長、教育資助委員會主席唐家成先生、理大校董會主席陳子政先生、理大校長唐偉章教授、五院黨委書記兼副院長趙小津先生、五院總體部部長孫京先生，以及五院處長何楠女士。\n理大校董會主席陳子政先生致歡迎辭時說：「理大是香港唯一擁有航太任務實戰經驗的高等院校，我們的科研人員自1990年代開始參與國家和國際的太空探索研究。理大很高興與五院再次合作推動太空科技研究，研發火星巡視器的『落火狀態監視相機』，支持國家的火星探索項目。我們期盼進一步發揮理大的專長，為國家的航天事業發展作出更多貢獻。」\n理大在研發精密太空儀器方面經驗豐富，這次合作將由其工業及系統工程學系精密工程講座教授及副系主任容啓亮教授率領二十名理大研究人員，與五院的專家緊密合作，共同研發「火星相機」。\n該「火星相機」不僅要重量輕巧（約380克），同時須十分堅固，以抵受穿梭地球與火星長期出現的極端溫差（超過九個月），及後須能在火星極低溫下運作，並要承受相等於地球地心吸力6,200倍的沖擊震盪。此外，「火星相機」須具備廣闊測量視野（水平視野範圍和垂直視野範圍分別均達120度），同時將圖像變形保持於低水平。\n容教授表示：「這次研發工作面對兩大挑戰：這台相機要十分輕盈，有廣闊的拍攝角度及減少影像變形之餘，要同時能抵受極強大的沖擊力；第二是令相機在長時間的太空旅程中克服極端溫差、輻射、機械振動等挑戰，最後仍保持十分高的穩定性。」\n憑藉理大過往參與多項太空探索項目的經驗以及具備的核心研發技術，研究團隊有信心能順利製成「火星相機」，並於明年內通過多項相關的太空驗證，完成交付「火星相機」，為2020年的火星探測項目作好準備。\n理大多年來積極參與不同的太空探究項目，研製先進的太空儀器，包括為歐洲太空總署2003年火星快車任務研發「岩芯取樣器」，並為2011年的中俄聯合探索火星任務研發「行星表土準備系統」。\n理大是香港唯一擁有國際太空任務實戰經驗的高等院校，自2010年起與五院長期緊密合作，為國家的太空探究項目作出貢獻不遺餘力。理大和五院曾簽約合作建立一所「空間精密機械技術聯合實驗室」，而五院亦向聯合實驗室送出先進設施。為支持國家的探月工程，容教授亦與內地的專家攜手研製出「相機指向機構系統」，應用於嫦娥三號及嫦娥四號；以及應用於嫦娥五號及嫦娥六號的「表取採樣執行裝置原理樣機」。\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will collaborate with the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) to develop and produce a camera on the spacecraft to Mars scheduled for launch in 2020 at the earliest. The two parties signed the Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (R&DA) on Mars Exploration Project (“the Collaborative Agreement”) at a ceremony today (22 August 2018).\nThe project is in support of the nation’s first Mars probe tentatively scheduled for 2020, which aims to conduct an orbital and surface exploration of Mars in a single mission, the first-ever attempt in the world.\nThe spacecraft for the Mars probe will compose of an orbiter, a lander and a rover. Under the Collaborative Agreement, PolyU is to design and produce a camera, “Mars Landing Surveillance Camera” (“Mars Camera”), which will be located on the outside top surface of the Mars Lander. The Mars Camera will monitor the deployment status of the Mars Rover with respect to the status of the solar panel, antenna, as well as the rover’s movement. The information is critical for the successful movement of the Mars Rover onto the Mars surface.\nProfessor Alex WAI, Vice President (Research Development) of PolyU, and Ms ZHOU Hong, Senior Vice President of CAST, signed the Collaborative Agreement on PolyU campus. Witnesses of the ceremony were: Mr Kevin YEUNG, Secretary for Education, HKSAR Government; Professor LI Lu, Director General of Education, Science and Technology Department, The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in HKSAR; Mr Carlson TONG, Chairman, University Grants Committee; Mr T C CHAN, Chairman of the Council, PolyU; Professor Timothy W. TONG, President of PolyU; Mr ZHAO Xiaojin, Executive Senior Vice President, CAST; Mr SUN Jing , Director General, Institute of Spacecraft System Engineering, CAST; and Ms HE Nan, Director, Institute of Spacecraft System Engineering, CAST.\nChairman of the PolyU Council, Mr T C CHAN, said at his welcome remarks, “PolyU is the only tertiary education institution in Hong Kong with experience in space missions. Our researchers have been involved in a number of national and international space exploration projects since the 1990s. It is our pleasure to work with CAST again to advance space technology and research through the joint development of Mars Landing Surveillance Camera, and support the nation's Mars Exploration Programme. We are keen to capitalise PolyU’s expertise to further contribute to the development of the nation’s space industry.”\nCapitalising on its wealth of experience in developing state-of-the-art space tools, PolyU will mobilise a 20-member-strong research team led by Professor YUNG Kai-leung, Chair Professor of Precision Engineering and Associate Head of its Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, to work closely with CAST experts on the development of the Mars Camera.\nThe Mars Camera will have to be light in weight (around 380 grammes) while strong and durable under extreme temperatures during the extended period of space travelling between Earth and Mars (over nine months), followed by operation under extremely low temperature on the Mars surface. It will also be able to tolerate impact shock of 6,200G (i.e. 6,200 times of the force of earth’s gravity). Despite having a wide angle field of view (a maximum of 120 degrees horizontally and a maximum of 120 degrees vertically), the Mars Camera will have low image distortion.\nProfessor YUNG said, “Among all the difficulties in the research and development (R&D) work, the two biggest challenges are the wide field of view with low distortion optics under high impact force with little available mass, and the high reliability required under a prolong period of extreme temperatures, radiation, mechanical vibration, etc.”\nThe PolyU team, capitalizing on its experiences of previous space projects and synergising core technologies ready for its R&D work, is confident to complete and deliver the Mars Camera with the corresponding space qualification experiments within next year, ready for the launch in 2020.\nPolyU has been actively participating in space exploration projects through designing and manufacturing sophisticated space tools in the past decade. These include the “Mars Rock Corer” for the European Space Agency’s 2003 Mars Express Mission, the “Soil Preparation System” for the Sino-Russian Space Mission in 2011.\nBeing the only tertiary institution in Hong Kong that possesses international space qualification experiences, PolyU has been contributing unreservedly to the nation’s space projects since the longstanding partnership between PolyU and CAST began in 2010. The two parties signed a pact for the establishment of a Joint Laboratory in Precision Engineering for Space Applications, and CAST donated advanced space research equipment to the Joint Laboratory. In the nation’s lunar exploration programme, Professor YUNG collaborated with the mainland experts to develop a “Camera Pointing System” for Chang’e 3 and Chang’e 4, and then the “Surface Sampling and Packing System” for Chang’e 5 and Chang’e 6.\nSource: PolyU website\nMedia Coverage\nRTHK1 – News – 22 Aug\nhttp://trsurl.com/s/fu8\nRTHK 3 - Newswrap (00:33:33 - 00:36:21) - 22 Aug\nhttp://podcast.rthk.hk/podcast/item_epi.php?pid=876\nRTHK 3 - News at Eleven (00:23:49 - 00:26:33) – 22 Aug\nhttp://podcast.rthk.hk/podcast/item_epi.php?pid=917\nRTHK 1 - 晨早新聞天地 (00:55:17 -00:59:38 ) – 23 Aug\nhttp://podcast.rthk.hk/podcast/item_epi.php?pid=916\nRTHK 3 - Hong Kong Today (01:16:12 - 01:18:13) – 23 Aug\nhttp://podcast.rthk.hk/podcast/item_epi.php?pid=78\nTVB\nhttp://trsurl.com/s/fu7\n奇妙電視\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik6H7TzXXgI\nCRHK\nhttp://trsurl.com/s/fu9\nSpeakout\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3TKQ12PWQ4\nBastille Post\nhttp://trsurl.com/s/fum\n中央廣電總台國際線上\nhttp://trsurl.com/s/fup\n中评网\nhttp://trsurl.com/s/fuq\n中国新闻网\nhttp://trsurl.com/s/fur",

  "text": "Meeting link will be sent to successful registrants\nPerception and navigation are essential capabilities for intelligent unmanned systems which have a lot of applications in intelligent transportation, surveillance, structure inspection, logistics, and service. GPS has been widely used for positioning and navigation. However, in indoor and many outdoor environments such as urban canon, forest, tunnel, GPS may not be available or unreliable. Hence, there has been a lot of studies on perception and localization based on various sensors such as WiFi, UWB, camera, LiDAR and radar. Each type of sensor has its pros and cons. Different application scenario will require different sensors and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. To achieve accurate and reliable localization in complex and dynamic environments, heterogeneous sensor fusion has been a recent trend and attracted significant interest. In this talk, we shall present some recent development leveraging on heterogenous sensor fusion and deep learning algorithms for perception and localization, and discuss possible future directions of the area. The applications of unmanned systems in structure inspection and logistics will be demonstrated.\nProf. Lihua Xie\nProfessor, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering\nNanyang Technological University, Singapore\nLihua Xie is a professor with School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University and Director, Center for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN).

  "text": "Event \nDepartment of Industrial and Systems Engineering, PolyU; State Key Laboratory of Ultra-precision Machining Technology (SKL-UPMT)\nMy research vision is to bring innovations to precision engineering by pushing the limit of and expanding the boundary of precision manufacturing. Conventionally, vibration is undesirable in any precision equipment and processes; however, when vibration is deliberately introduced with a careful design, it can bring unprecedented process capabilities and novel precision machine tool designs. In this talk, I will present two examples that apply unorthodox vibration in the precision cutting process and bearing designs. The first example introduces a vibration-assisted ultraprecision cutting method to fast pattern controllable wavelength-scale gratings for structural coloration and advanced optics. In the second example, I will introduce the design and dynamics modeling of non-contact actuation purely based on structural vibration to generate a stable air film in the near field. Finally, I will briefly share some other ongoing research projects that hopefully bring inspiration to future precision engineering.\nDr Ping Guo\nAssistant Professor,\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering,\nNorthwestern University\nDr. Ping Guo is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University.

Details can be found at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/scholarships. It is subject to change and will be announced on department website in due course.\nTwo full-time programmes are offered under this scheme:\nBEng (Hons) in Product Engineering with Marketing (BEng PEM)\nBEng (Hons) in Industrial and Systems Engineering (BEng ISE)\nBEng PEM\nProgramme Aims and Learning Outcomes\nProduct design and development have become increasingly complex in recent years, due to decreasing time to market, increasing customer expectations, and growing global competition. Today, product engineers carry out product design and development tasks that go beyond functional or engineering design to incorporate consideration of aesthetic and business issues, product life-cycle design, and technologies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for product development professionals who are sufficiently innovative, knowledgeable, and skilful to synergise product development with design, technology, and business aspects to develop novel products with immediate market appeal.\nTo fulfil this need, the BEng (Hons) in Product Engineering with Marketing programme has the following aims and learning outcomes:\nProvide integrated education and training for students on synergising product design, technology and business in new product development\nDevelop students' knowledge of business development, strategic product planning, product marketing and management and help them understand how to apply this knowledge to the development of successful new products\nNurture graduates with excellent product design and development abilities who can interact with customers, industrial designers, production personnel, suppliers and vendors; understand market situations and competition environments; and identify market needs and seize opportunities by developing new products that satisfy customer and engineering requirements.\nProgramme Characteristics\nThe programme provides comprehensive education and training in the development of successful new products, enabling students to synthesise product design, technology, and business processes.\nThe integrative and problem-based teaching and learning approach of the programme develops students' knowledge of product design, development and marketing and their communication, teamwork, management and self-learning skills. Graduates are equipped to play leading roles in the industry by virtue of their well-balanced education and practical training.\nBEng ISE\nProgramme Aims and Learning Outcomes\nIndustrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) is a professional discipline that focuses on developing and implementing optimal solutions from a system-level perspective. This involves people, technology, quality, finance, information, and environmental issues. The main task of an industrial and systems engineer is to organise and work harmoniously with others to streamline operational procedures and improve productivity and overall system performance. The ultimate goals of these efforts are to increase efficiency, to reduce operating costs, and to increase customer satisfaction. ISE is different from other traditional engineering disciplines, in which knowledge and skills are applied to specific areas; for example, traditional manufacturing engineers usually work in a production environment. In contrast, ISE provides students with the opportunity to work in a variety of organisations in both the industrial and commercial sectors. This broad exposure and experience give industrial and systems engineers flexible career paths. Thus, ISE graduates are employed in a wide range of areas and settings, such as new product development for transportation, theme parks, logistics services, banking, public utilities, business development consultancy, and government departments. The ultimate objective of the ISE discipline is to provide leadership in the design of integrated industrial and commercial systems for the advancement and well-being of the community.\nProgramme Characteristics\nThe hallmarks of this programme are its emphasis on student-centred learning and its integration of theory and practice.\nIn their final year, students can specialise in areas such as manufacturing engineering, logistics engineering, and Internet of things through the selection of a Final Year Project and Electives, with the latter selected from a large pool of options.\nIn addition to the normal curriculum, Work-Integrated Education (WIE) is incorporated into the programme to ensure that students gain work experience relevant to their studies. This enables students to better understand the relevance of their academic studies and enhances their all-round development.\nSummer placement opportunities may be available to students to give them practical work experience.\nStudents also have the opportunity to participate in the student exchange programme, during which they spend one semester in universities in countries such as the US, Canada, Sweden, or Finland.",

They are subject to change and will be announced on department website in due course.\nTwo full-time programmes are offered under this scheme:\nBEng (Hons) in Product Engineering with Marketing (BEng PEM)\nBEng (Hons) in Industrial and Systems Engineering (BEng ISE)\nBEng PEM\nProgramme Aims and Learning Outcomes\nProduct design and development have become increasingly complex in recent years, due to decreasing time to market, increasing customer expectations, and growing global competition. Today, product engineers carry out product design and development tasks that go beyond functional or engineering design to incorporate consideration of aesthetic and business issues, product life-cycle design, and technologies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for product development professionals who are sufficiently innovative, knowledgeable, and skilful to synergise product development with design, technology, and business aspects to develop novel products with immediate market appeal.\nTo fulfil this need, the BEng(Hons) in Product Engineering with Marketing programme has the following aims and learning outcomes:\nProvide integrated education and training for students on synergising product design, technology and business in new product development\nDevelop students’ knowledge of business development, strategic product planning, product marketing and management and help them understand how to apply this knowledge to the development of successful new products\nNurture graduates with excellent product design and development abilities who can interact with customers, industrial designers, production personnel, suppliers and vendors; understand market situations and competition environments; and identify market needs and seize opportunities by developing new products that satisfy customer and engineering requirements.\nProgramme Characteristics\nThe programme provides comprehensive education and training in the development of successful new products, enabling students to synthesise product design, technology, and business processes.\nThe integrative and problem-based teaching and learning approach of the programme develops students’ knowledge of product design, development and marketing and their communication, teamwork, management and self-learning skills. Graduates are equipped to play leading roles in the industry by virtue of their well-balanced education and practical training.\nBEng ISE\nProgramme Aims and Learning Outcomes\nIndustrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) is a professional discipline that focuses on developing and implementing optimal solutions from a system-level perspective. This involves people, technology, quality, finance, information, and environmental issues. The main task of an industrial and systems engineer is to organise and work harmoniously with others to streamline operational procedures and improve productivity and overall system performance. The ultimate goals of these efforts are to increase efficiency, to reduce operating costs, and to increase customer satisfaction. ISE is different from other traditional engineering disciplines, in which knowledge and skills are applied to specific areas; for example, traditional manufacturing engineers usually work in a production environment. In contrast, ISE provides students with the opportunity to work in a variety of organisations in both the industrial and commercial sectors. This broad exposure and experience give industrial and systems engineers flexible career paths. Thus, ISE graduates are employed in a wide range of areas and settings, such as new product development for transportation, theme parks, logistics services, banking, public utilities, business development consultancy, and government departments. The ultimate objective of the ISE discipline is to provide leadership in the design of integrated industrial and commercial systems for the advancement and well-being of the community.\nProgramme Characteristics\nThe hallmarks of this programme are its emphasis on student-centred learning and its integration of theory and practice.\nIn their final year, students can specialise in areas such as manufacturing engineering, logistics engineering, and Internet of things through the selection of a Final Year Project and Electives, with the latter selected from a large pool of options.\nIn addition to the normal curriculum, Work-Integrated Education (WIE) is incorporated into the programme to ensure that students gain work experience relevant to their studies. This enables students to better understand the relevance of their academic studies and enhances their all-round development.\nSummer placement opportunities may be available to students to give them practical work experience.\nStudents also have the opportunity to participate in the student exchange programme, during which they spend one semester in universities in countries such as the US, Canada, Sweden, or Finland.",

After finishing the intensive 14 months flying training in Adelaide, Australia, I returned to Hong Kong in Sept 2013 and joined the Cathay team as a Second Officer. My duties involve being part of the flight crew and mainly acting as a relief pilot on ultra long haul operations. It is undoubtedly the ultimate excitement to fly around the world with the fleet of CX Boeing 777-300ER airliners where my roster sends me to major cities in Europe and North America. \nMy study in ISE was very enjoyable and knowledgeable.

  "text": "Background, Vision & Mission \nBehaviour and Knowledge Engineering Research Centre BAKE (former Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Centre) focuses on behaviour engineering and design of human-centered systems. The developed expertise can contribute to numerous technology and service developments in Hong Kong.\nThe Research Centre was set up in 2007 in the name of Knowledge Management Research Centre (KMRC) which was renamed as Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Centre (KMIRC) in 2011. It is unique of its kind in Hong Kong and Mainland China.\nSince the early 1990s, the importance of Knowledge Management (KM) to create an organization's competitive advantage has been widely recognised worldwide in the government, public and private sectors for the codification of information and knowledge, the processing of knowledge (the creation, capture, storage and conversion of knowledge from implicit to explicit), to the reporting and management of Intellectual Capital (IC), innovation and learning capability in firms and organisations. KM is an interdisciplinary and complex area of study by integrating technology-centred and human-centred approaches from the perspective of system science.\nBAKE has a core group of well regarded practitioners and researchers with established track record in Organisational Learning (OL), Culture and Change, Intellectual Capital Management, Knowledge Audit, Knowledge Systems, and E-Learning. The Capabilities and competencies of the Centre are further strengthened by the international alliances it has formed with leading practitioners and renowned research centres worldwide.\nThe Centre's core work falls into three areas - Teaching/Training, Research, and Professional Services/Consultancy. The Centre operates executive short course in knowledge management. Furthermore, numerous customised KM workshops have been designed and delivered for government departments and private enterprises in Hong Kong Mainland China, Australian, Malaysian and Brunei.\nThe Centre is actively engaged in various research activities and research projects and the research results have been disseminated through the publications of research papers. It has also participated in various exhibitions and organised seminars and training sessions for various industrial sectors. Over the past years, it has undertaken consultancy work in various sectors ranging from public utilities, aviation, government, manufacturing, social work, printing and publishing, as well as healthcare.\nVision and Mission\nTo conduct applied research in areas associated with the interface of technology, human operators and knowledge systems in the recommendation of best practices.\nTo promote the interdisciplinary area of behavioral and knowledge engineering, through research, consultancy, training for various industrial sectors, organizations and communities.\nTo participate in joint research and collaborative projects with leading institutes and organizations.",

Awesome!”\n“That’s how things are! Do as you are told and don’t ask why!” \nAccording to a ManpowerGroup report, globally nearly one third of the current workforce is from Generation Z or those born between the late 90’s to the early 2010’s. So, most likely, one of your co-workers is from Gen Z. Have you noticed, and is this a good thing or does this fill you with dread? The answer, like what consultants will say is ‘It depends!’\nThere are many commonly held ideas about Gen Z and their work ethic. The positive perception is that Gen Z is tech-savvy and will suggest quick and pragmatic solutions to streamline their work. Gen Z can be counted on to voice out creative ideas and take on challenging assignments. On the other hand, they are regarded as less motivated, isolated from their teams, and disengaged from their jobs. They are prone to anxiety caused by stressful environments and insensitive to the social politics in the office. When working with your Gen Z colleagues, are these the attitudes you have encountered? Are these myths widely shared and are they even true?\nThis all feels like the parable of the blind men and the elephant when each person perceives a different part of an elephant. To be able to see the whole picture, Association of KM Practitioners (KMP) is providing a platform where you can openly communicate with Gen Zs. The event is organized by KMP, a community formed by MSc in Knowledge Management graduates to support promotion of KM to the general public in Hong Kong. Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Centre (KMIRC) is the co-organizer of this event.\nTo liven up to the spirit of ‘Let’s talk on air’, we will open the platform to the participants after the panel discussion. Please join us and seize the opportunity to understand how Gen Zs think and act.\nFor more details, please click here.",

  "text": "Knowledge Elicitation in Organization Studies: What are the alternate research methods to avoid subjectivity?\n28 Jul 2021 - 28 Jul 2021\n3:00pm - 5:00pm (GMT+8)\nOnline\nProf. Rongbin W.B. Lee, Prof. Garry Tan Wei Han and Prof. Ooi Keng-Boon\nThe mainstream research methods in social, business and organization studies are hypothesis testing based on questionnaire surveys and interviews. Such approach appears to be objective to make generalizations and predictions on human behaviour. However, the effectiveness of these generalizations (often called grand theories) are limited in organization development studies such as business reengineering, team building, leadership training, job enrichment etc. to inform good professional practices in individual business settings. Knowledge and input from various stakeholders of an organization are required in the formulation of new initiatives for each case under investigation.\nThere have been few researches that explore the knowledge elicitation issue in the organizational context, as well as on the role of the researcher in eliciting different kinds of knowledge. A deep rooted assumption in both physical and social sciences is that there exists an objective reality for us to explore. This is a well accepted belief in our Newtonian worldview that is now being challenged. The limitations of traditional research methods are addressed and alternative research paradigms such as design based research, participatory or collaborative research, storytelling, pre-hypothesis research are introduced and illustrated with examples and real cases.",

Digital Transformation is the biggest strategic issue facing organisations and being able to influence the direction they take is our most exciting opportunity.\nThe future will be built on a mix of technology, culture, and new styles of leadership, all of which call on us to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges. Learning faster and sharing better was always the promise of the internet but we have rather gone astray. How do we rediscover the power, literally in our own hands, of helping ourselves, and our organisations, to survive and to thrive?\nBio\nEuan Semple has been a leader and an influencer in the ever changing field of digital technology for two decades. An early adopter of social media he implemented one of the world's first enterprise social network systems inside the BBC. He also ran BBC DigiLab, a department whose purpose was to help the BBC understand new technologies across the range of its activities and make better decisions about their use and implementation. \nHe left the BBC in 2006 to establish his own consultancy and has subsequently worked around the world with an amazing range of organisations including BP, The World Bank, The European commission, and Volvo. His work with them has been to help stretch their thinking about digital transformation in all its forms and to ensure that they end up doing the right things for the right reasons.\nEuan is also a Principal Advisor for CIO Connect HK, an advisory service for CIOs and business leaders.\nII :- The Role of KM in Organisational Culture, Agility and Resilience\nSpeaker: Professor Dave Snowden Cognitive Edge ,UK\nThe Role of KM in Organisational Culture, Agility and Resilience\nManaging knowledge should always have been focused in making better decisions and creating the conditions for innovation. The ability to do that effectively requires a culture of collaboration and self-organisation which is difficult to achieve in the normal goal orientated approaches that are too common in modern organisations. We need to start journeys with a sense of direction and purpose but the flexibility to adapt to circumstances that could not have been anticipated at the time. How do we map our culture? How do we make sure that it has sufficient cognitive and experiential diversity to ensure resilience and sustainability? How do we accommodate and work with conflict for positive outcomes. Above all how do ensure the continuous development of knowledge not just in codified form, but also through the oral tradition and trans-generational practice.\nBio\nProf. Dave Snowden\nDirector Cynefin Centre and Chief Scientific Officer\nThe Cynefin Centre exists to apply natural science to social systems in particular Complexity Theory and the Cognitive Sciences. It arises from Dave’s original work in IBM’s Institute for Knowledge Management where he created an approach which became known as Organic Knowledge Management, challenging the dominant idea that knowledge had to be codified. \nHe was one of the early practitioner/academics to challenge the validity of Nonaka’s SECI model. His paper from that period Complex Acts of Knowing is one of the top ten cited papers in the field and his HBR cover article in Leadership is the third most sited in the field of Complexity and Leadership. His business career began in Decision Support System Design in a UK firm in the early days of computing where he rose to the position of General Manager and Strategy Director. Following an IBM takeover of his company, he moved to research/Thought Leadership role in IBM and developed a body of work on weak signal detection for DARPA before and after 911. He left IBM 16 years ago to create Cognitive Edge and co-designed Singapore Government’s Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning System. \nHe has a BA in Philosophy and an MBA in Financial Management and also holds visiting Chairs at the Universities of Pretoria, Stellenbosch and Hull. Over years he has held various other academic positions and acting as an advisor at board level to a range of companies and other bodies around the world.\nIII :- Applying AI to Language\nSpeaker : Dion Wiggins , Omniscien , Thailand\nApplying AI to Language \nMost applications of AI are focused around numeric challenges. However, recent applications of AI in the processing of text across languages is quickly changing the perspective of where machine learning and AI techniques can be applied to solve complex problems. Research and commercial development has now begun to focus on comprehensive workflows the leverage ensemble data from many sources into a more accurate and reliable outcomes that often far exceed human capabilities.\nCase studies in this presentation represent the different contexts of machine translation, media processing, ecommerce, fraud detection and employee motivation from the perspective of working with, processing and understanding language and the resulting benefits to the business and employees.\nBio\nDion Wiggins, Omniscien Technologies’ CTO and Co-Founder, is a highly experienced ICT industry visionary, entrepreneur, analyst and consultant. He has comprehensive knowledge in the fields of software development, architecture and management, as well as an in-depth understanding of Asian ICT markets. He is an accomplished speaker and has a high media profile for his perceptive analysis of ICT in Asia Pacific.\nPreviously Dion was Vice President and Research Director for Gartner based in Hong Kong, where his research reports on ICT in China had a crucial impact on how the world views this market. Dion is also a well-known pioneer of the Asian Internet Industry, being the founder of one of Asia’s first ever ISPs (Asia Online in Hong Kong). In his role as consultant, Dion advised literally hundreds of enterprises on their ICT strategy.\nIV :- Computer Vision and AI\nSpeaker: Niall Dorr imagedeep , HK Speaker: Niall Dorr\nComputer Vision and AI\nComputer Vision is a technology that is improving every year. As the software gets easier to understand and as the Cloud players are in full push mode for customers to use their AI algorithms the propagation of 'computers that see' will gain traction.\nAs a practical engineer, Niall will begin by explaining in simple terms what computer vision is and then chart a variety of case studies of commercial applications. Based on more than 25 years’ experience , Niall will also highlight some of the show the pit falls that need to be avoided in implanting Computer Vision. \nHe will end by addressing when does a AI engine succeed the human outputs in the work place. First lesson, it’s not the technology that wins, it’s the process. \nBio\nNiall is the solutions advisor to ImageDeep Solutions, a Hong Kong based AI company.\nHe has worked over 25 years in the computer vision industry since qualifying as an Telecommunications Engineering graduate of Trinity College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of technology. He has a wealth of start up experience with a number of companies being sold in excess of $100m to multinational companies. He is the co-inventor of US issued patents in applied computer vision and optics. He has published papers and articles on Intelligent Transport Systems and Automated Optical Inspection solutions.\nPrior to Hong Kong, Niall was the operations director to the third largest Airport in the middle east, applying automated technology to identify and decrease revenue leakage points and to optimise security awareness.\nNiall's interests include Robotics, Advanced Driver Assist systems, Remote real-time monitoring and the application of Fused AI to Digital Transformation.\nV :-Innovation and profit growth through collaborative knowledge cocreation\nSpeaker : Arthur Shelley ,Australia\nInnovation and profit growth through collaborative knowledge cocreation\nWe all know that collaboration is a good thing and has inherent social value. However, like knowledge sharing and loyalty, it does not get the leadership investment and attention it should in most workplaces. The presentation will share how a knowledge ecosystem fuels the success of a fast growing and highly profitable entrepreneurial business. Blackmagic Design, a Melbourne based entrepreneurial broadcast technology enterprise that adapts its products so fast that competitors can’t keep up. They implement the principles of collaboration, creativity and inclusive conversations to stimulate sustained innovation and growth. In their first 16 years of operation, Blackmagic Design moved from a self-funded start up to over USD300 Million turnover, with good profitability, no debt and no external ownership.\nDr Arthur Shelley is an independent educator and capability development consultant with over 30 years professional experience. He has held a variety of professional roles including managing international projects in Australia, Europe, Asia and USA.

He has also written chapters for edited books, articles for academic and professional journals and has a regular blog providing insights from his research about metaphor and behaviour. In 2014 he was awarded with an Australian Office of Learning and Teaching citation for “Outstanding contributions to student learning outcomes.”\nVI :-Can Artificial Intelligence be Creative?\nSpeaker : Vincent Ribere ,Thailand\nCan Artificial Intelligence be Creative?\nVarious studies predict that in few decades many procedural jobs will be replaced by computers and robots, but can computers also take over jobs involving some levels of creativity? Until recently, most researchers will have answered “No” to this question, but recent advances in the field of AI might make them think twice. During his talk Vincent will present how AI can practically contribute to the various aspects and processes of Creativity. \nDr. Vincent Ribiere is an enthusiastic and creative International consultant and professor with a passion for helping organizations solving their organizational knowledge and innovation management challenges. He is the Founder and Managing Director of the Institute for Knowledge and Innovation Southeast Asia (IKI-SEA), a center of Excellence at Bangkok University as well as the Program Director of the Ph.D. in KM and Innovation Management.\nHe has also co-founded various Internationals events in the fields of Business Creativity and Innovation (Creative Bangkok, ASCIM, CreativeMornings Bangkok, G-LINK) and he co-founded various communities of KM and Innovation academics and practitioners nationally (iKlub, Thai KM Network) and Internationally (KM Global Network).\nVincent has a strong entrepreneurial spirit and he enjoys sharing his knowledge and experiences. He delivers keynote speeches and workshops at various International Professional and Academic conferences and he is the Author of more than 80 publications.\nVII :-Making Knowledge visible in Emergency Management\nSpeaker : Stuart French, Country Fire Authority in Melbourne, Australia \nMaking Knowledge Visible in Emergency Management\nThe Country Fire Authority manages 53,000 volunteer fire fighters in one of the most fire-prone environments in the world. Knowledge of safe & effective practices, local geography, resources and critical infrastructure is essential to achieving our mission of saving lives and property from fire, and yet managers struggle to manage the generation and transfer of this knowledge due to it's intangible nature.\nJust like Watson and Crick changed all of biology when they visualized the double-helix structure of the DNA molecule, the CFA needed a way to visualize knowledge across the agency in order to protect brigades from critical knowledge loss, as well as make better use of the knowledge assets spread across the organisation.\nA tool has been developed and ground tested as a proof of concept and has been met with enthusiasm by head-office and regional leaders as a way of identifying current and future areas of concern as well as identifying the impact of local leaders on the sustainable management of volunteer fire brigades. This presentation outlines the development of the tool and discusses some of the dashboards and the questions they answer.\nAn insight into the concept of making intangible assets tangible\nAn example of one way this has been done in a highly visual and interactive way\nStuart is currently the head of the Knowledge Program at the Country Fire Authority in Melbourne Victoria. With a Master’s degree in Knowledge Management and many years in high-tech, high change environments, he applies KM principles to digital transformation projects ensuring that success is built on maximizing the potential of both people and technology.\nStuart's focus on collaboration tools and cultures and using knowledge for learning and innovation have seen him work in multiple industries from government to waste to finance and emergency management. He has played a leadership role in the KM community both locally in Melbourne and internationally with the KM Global Network and love evangelizing the power and effectiveness of good knowledge management.\nVIII :-Why do People Seek Knowledge? Tracing Factors that Affect Knowledge Seeking Intention\nSpeaker: Manoj Hariharan ,India\nWhy do People Seek Knowledge? Tracing Factors that Affect Knowledge Seeking Intention\nThe field of Knowledge Management has enormous understanding about the motives and means for sharing knowledge and how organizations create facilitating conditions to foster a sharing culture. i.e., the producer side of the knowledge economy seems well addressed. A brief look at existing social media platforms reaffirms this understanding. But what about the consumer problem? In this talk, Manoj will outline factors that affects the employee’s knowledge seeking intention from a study that he conducted together with a research scholar in his organization. Manoj believes that the field of Knowledge Management needs to readjust the focus towards the other side of the coin.\nManoj Hariharan , Knowledge Management Divisional Module Owner, KM-DMO , Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited, RBEI\nIn his role as KM-DMO since 2014, Manoj presents a holistic picture of the elaborate set of KM methods and tools available at Bosch.

In recent years, the advent of big data and new computing capabilities leads to on-going revolutions in data science and new business opportunities. However, this does not mean intellectual capitals accumulated over the years are of little value in the new information age. Using modelling examples of different complexity in the aviation industry, this speech demonstrates how various business analytic approaches can attack different types of business problems, and how big data can facilitate the application of evolving econometric models. The project examples also highlight the importance of understanding market-specific conditions, which help explain the unexpected data patterns.\nMr Don Ward\nChief Executive \nConstructing ExcellenceDon Ward has been Chief Executive of Constructing Excellence, the UK industry think tank and best practice organisation which is now part of the BRE Trust group of companies, for twelve years.

  "text": "INTERNET OF THINGS\nIoT has been identified as one of China's strategic emerging industries. In 2012, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China (MIIT) promulgated the Development Programme of the Internet of Things in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, which undoubtedly bodes very well for China's developing IoT. As the key technology in IoT, RFID is bound to see its application expanded in tandem with the development of the IoT, and being one of the nine key areas for development, smart transport is on track for rapid development and maturing under national planning.\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union, an IoT refers to a network where the sensor links any object with the Internet according to a protocol, and engages in an exchange of information and communication, in order to achieve intelligent identification, positioning, trace and track, control and monitor, and management1. It is a network extended and expanded based on the Internet.\n1國際電信聯盟,「物聯網技術」,物聯網 演義(二)— ITU 互聯網報告 2005:物 聯網 2005 年,2005 年。 \nThe concept of IoT was proposed by the Auto-ID Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At present, the whole world is filled with a variety of interconnected smart devices, and the intelligent era has quietly arrived. In 2009, China's then Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, put forward the \"Reading China\" concept in Wuxi, China, which called for the speedy establishment of China's \"Reading China” centre and a focus on the development of a new generation of information technology, such as, the combination of IoT and cloud computing. Even since then, a revolution has been in the making under China's IoT era.\nIoT and related new technologies are undergoing rapid development worldwide and have been applied to a number of key areas. In 2012, the Chinese market for the IoT industry reached RMB 365 billion, which is an increase of 38.6% compared with 2011. With the rapid development of China's IoT industry and the emergence of industrial scale clusters, an industrial revolution is underway in the era of China's IoT. Specifically, China's IoT technology has been integrated into all walks of life in different areas. Key areas include:\n1Urban management: Such as, monitoring and intelligent management systems.\n2Environment and safety tests: Such as, smart waste disposal, automatic monitoring devices, water quality monitoring system, as well as regional ecological monitoring system.\n3Healthcare: Such as, electronic medical records, medical supplies tracking, quality control systems and wireless comprehensive smart hospitals.\n4Intelligent transport: Such as, intelligent traffic signal control systems, electronic police system, traffic video surveillance, positioning systems and electronic road pricing. (Figure 1-1)\nFigure 1-1: Applications of IoT\nThroughout the Development Programme of the Internet of Things in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China, applications of the IoT in China cover the following areas: smart power grid, smart transport, smart logistics, smart homes, environment and safety tests, industrial and automated control, healthcare, precision farming and national defence.\nAccording to the latest forecast by analyst, Mason, the number of IoT devices will grow to 16 billion by 20202. Independent technology and market research company, Forrester, expects that by 2020, revenue from the IoT industry worldwide will be 30 times the revenue from Internet-related business, and by then, the IoT will have connected more than 100 billion devices. Wang Jianzhou, former Chairman and CEO of China Mobile, China's largest mobile communications service provider, expects in the next decade, 50 billion devices will be connected to the IoT3. IoT Industry Alliance Z-Park expects that China's IoT industry will reach one trillion yuan by 2015; until 2020 and more than 5 trillion yuan by 20204.\nA complete IoT system consists of four layers: the sensor layer, the network layer, the platform layer and the application layer (Figure 1-2).\n2 英國每日電訊報,2010 年 11 月 3 日。 \n3 林妍,「物聯網安全嗎?嬰兒監控器夜半驚魂」,大紀元,2014 年 5 月 14 日。 \n4 台灣區電機電子工業同蘇公會,「下個兆元通訊產業 - 商機超越網際網路 30 倍」。\nFigure 1-2: Component layers of an IoT system \nIn view of its potentials in development and application, IoT has been put into rigorous development by various countries in recent years. However, there are several factors that hinder its development, including wide-ranging and changing user needs, a lack of internationally-recognised industry technical standards, nearly exhaustion of the limited IPV4 resources and the security, reliability and privacy doubts and reservations in people collecting large amounts of data, etc. All these bring pressure on and hinder the development of the IoT5.\nThe following paragraphs introduce the key technologies of the IoT layers.\n5 「中國射頻識別(RFID)技術政策白皮書」,RFID 射頻快報,2006 年 6 月 9 日。",

  "text": "I am pleased and deeply honoured to be elected as the chairman of the MILES Alumni Association of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (MILESAA) for the term 2008-2010.\nAfter graduating from the former Hong Kong Polytechnic, I became one of the top executives of TDK, a leading multinational corporation in the global high-tech industries, overseeing its operations in the Greater China region, which holds the very key to its overall success. Fortunate as I am to have been given great career opportunities, I am not alone. There are many other fellow alumni who have become highly successful and well recognized in their own fields. They have become not only the backbone of many industries but have also considerably contributed to the wealth and prosperity of Hong Kong. It is no wonder that over the years, MILES alumni have been the most frequent recipients of the Outstanding PolyU Alumni Awards.\nEstablishing a career in engineering is incredibly challenging, with all the dynamics taking place within Hong Kong and in its fellow cities in the Pearl River Delta. Therefore, I see it as a rightful mission of the MILES and ours, as we enjoy our jobs in relatively well-established organizations, to work with our mother Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE)\nand to be able to help our young fellow graduates of ISE in the first stages of their careers. \nFor some of you who may be unaware, the MILES has a long history that started in 1994, when it was initially named The Hong Kong Polytechnic Manufacturing Engineering Association (HKPMFGAA). It was renamed Manufacturing Industrial and Engineering Alumni Association of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (MIEAA) in 2001 and again renamed MILES Alumni Association of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (MILESAA) in 2008. ‘MILES’ denotes Manufacturing, Industrial, Logistics, Enterprise and Systems, and it aptly represents a multitude of professional disciplines undertaken by members of the association.\nLooking forward, I will work closely with the executive committee of the MILESAA to maintain strong relationships with our fellow alumni. I will also endeavour to congregate the professional knowledge and experience of our alumni to make contributions continually to the Alumni Association, the ISE, the Alma Mater, and the Hong Kong community.\nWe will not be able to succeed without your support. Thus, I am looking forward to seeing the active participation of the fellow alumni, staff, and students of the Department in MILESAA in the near future.\nExecutive Committee (2008-2010) of the MILES Alumni Association of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nThe MILES Alumni Association of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (MILESAA) held its annual general meeting cum dinner talk at staff restaurant on 9 September 2008.\nMembers of the executive committee of the MILESAA for 2008-2010 were elected at the annual general meeting. Dr Raymond Leung Siu-hong, chairman and CEO of TDK China Co. Ltd. and chairman of SAE Magnetics (H.K.) Ltd., was elected new chairman.\nTwelve presidents and chairmen of various associations were invited to be the honorary advisors for MILESAA for 2008-2010.

The energy required is only one-half of that required for traditional LED road lighting. With the modular design, the system is adaptable to various road lighting standards and helps reduce the development cost. The modular design also enables better dissipation of heat and facilitates the replacement of deflective individual LED without the need to dismantle the whole lamp holder. This can significantly save on repair and maintenance cost. The product may also be used for other purposes such as outdoor advertising, decorative lighting, and indoor illumination.\nThis development garnered three international awards during the '36th Geneva International Exhibition Inventions, New Techniques, and Products (2008)'. The three awards were the Grand International Press Prize, a Gold Medal, and the Award of High Scientific and Technological Level of Invention. The project has attracted a number of industrial companies and government departments, whose representatives approached the members of the project team to enquire about the development of LED products.\nPhoto 3: Professor W.B.

Plastic micro injection moulding, being the most cost-effective method of producing high-accuracy micro features, inherits the challenges in the precision conveying and injection of very small amounts of material at high accuracy to mould the part with high dimensional stability and stiff thin structures. Current machines only attempt to reduce the size of conventional designs, but the Poly.U.-.designed. machine. adopts..a.2. revolutionary. .upward \ninjection design with only simple mechanical devices for high-speed precision melt injection and mechatronic control to feature performance optimization through software upgrades. \nThere are four servos each at the four corners of the mould that automatically adjust clamping pressure to assure effective mould closure. Two linear motors are used to propel the plastic into the mould, giving unmatched acceleration and precision well below the milligram level. Upward injection with high acceleration/deceleration of injection speed not only avoids air entrapment but also allows precision melt flow and volume controls. The precision is further enhanced by real-time pressure signature analysis to prevent any variations. \nThe state-of-the-art technology was developed at PolyU’s Microsystems Technology Centre, which was established in 2005 with substantial funding from the government’s Innovation and Technology Fund.\n....Photo 5: Prof. Yung Kai-leung, Associate Head (3rd from right) \n....with the other team members.

Although some claims regarding the merits of drinking wine are not yet taken as fact, no one can deny that moderate drinking truly brings us joy, and helps gather close friends. \nMILESAA organized a short, condensed wine tasting night for our interested members and graduates in May 2011.\nWe were glad to have Roy from Wine One as our instructor that night, and to have 16 interested members and graduates join us. Roy delivered an interesting and rich introductory talk on some basic wine knowledge. Not only did we spend time on theories, we also gained some practical self-experience in wine tasting after learning a few tips.\nLocation: Wine One Central Shop\nDate: 25 May 2011",

Lee\nBEng (PolyU), PhD (PolyU)\nStudents admitted to the scheme study the common curriculum for the first two years. They must select any one of the two honours degree awards no later than the end of the second semester of Year 2.\nThe credit requirements of this scheme are indicative only. They are subject to review.\nStudents will be awarded one of the following awards upon successful completion of the graduation requirements of the programme concerned: \nBSc (Hons) in Logistics Engineering with Management\nBSc (Hons) in Enterprise Engineering with Management\nStudents are allowed to enrol on any awards without being subject to further assessment.\nThe option of Secondary Major in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) is available to the students of BSc (Hons) in Logistics Engineering (a variant of BSc (Hons) in Logistics Engineering with Management). Admission to Secondary Major is on competitive basis and subject to a different credit requirement for graduation. Please see \"Secondary Major Details\" section.\nEntry Scholarship\nTo recognise the outstanding academic performance of students, the department will grant entry scholarship with total amount up to HK$30,000 to eligible students admitted to the scheme via Non-JUPAS local year 1 admission. Details can be found at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/scholarships. It is subject to change and will be announced on department website in due course.\nTwo full-time programmes are offered under this scheme:\nBSc (Hons) in Logistics Engineering with Management (BSc LEM)\nBSc (Hons) in Enterprise Engineering with Management (BSc EEM)\nBSc LEM\nManaging logistics is an interesting and complex task. It involves the effective management of materials, information, and finance in a network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers.\nThis programme aims to nurture logistics engineers and professionals who are competent in the design, implementation, control, and execution of logistics systems and related technologies and capable of managing complex business, logistics and technology systems for increasingly technology-enabled logistics enterprises.\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University possesses a broad array of expertise and talent that spans the entire spectrum of logistics. The programme provides comprehensive training in logistics systems, facility design, logistics information systems, supply chain management, and operations management. It also teaches the general management and business skills needed to manage and run modern logistics companies.\nIn addition to the academic curriculum, Work-Integrated Education (WIE) is incorporated into the programme to ensure that students gain real-life work experience that is relevant to their studies. This enables students to better understand the relevance of their academic efforts and enhances their all-round development.\nSummer placement opportunities may be available to students to enable them to gain practical work experience.\nStudents also have the opportunity to participate in the Student Exchange Programme, during which they spend one semester at a university in a country such as the US, Canada, Sweden, or Finland.\nBSc EEM\nEnterprises are industrial and commercial organisations that shape the modern economy. This programme aims to provide students with a body of knowledge, principles, and skills that are related to the analysis, design, implementation, and operation of the critical elements associated with the effective operation of modern enterprises. To be successful in today's highly competitive global business environment, an enterprise must be willing to undertake new activities and able to continuously optimise its operations.\nThis programme aims to generate a new tranche of professionals with the entrepreneurship skills and ability to integrate and apply engineering, business management, and information technology expertise to optimise the operations of modern information-based enterprises and workflows along the business value chains in which they operate.\nGraduates of this programme are capable of formulating problems, recognising the areas in an enterprise that require improvement, and devising and implementing strategies to produce solutions that enhance business efficiency and effectiveness. They enable enterprises to deliver quality goods and services that meet or exceed customer demands in today’s modern business environment.\nThe Curriculum\nThe programme curriculum is designed to suit students from arts, commerce, and science backgrounds. It comprises a unique and integrated combination of subjects that nurtures graduates who are competent in enterprise engineering, information technology and management. The curriculum includes subjects such as Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Integrative Studies in Enterprise Systems and Management, which equip students with the principles and hands-on experience needed to develop plans for starting up new businesses. A competition is held each year in the ISE Department for the best business plan, with industry practitioners invited to join academic staff members on the judging panel.\nTeaching Approach and Support Facilities\nOur teaching follows a student-centred and problem-based learning approach and is conducted with the support of the most advanced facilities in the region, including the PolyU Microsoft Enterprise Systems Centre. The Centre has laboratories focusing on business automation, logistics and simulation, and knowledge solutions.\nWork-Integrated Education\nIn addition to the normal curriculum, Work-Integrated Education (WIE) has been incorporated into the programme. The Department also makes every effort to secure industrial summer-training placements for students during their studies. These placements enable students to gain practical work experience.\nStudent Exchange to Overseas Universities\nStudents also have the opportunity to participate in the Student Exchange Programme, travelling to universities in North America, Europe and Asia, including the Chinese mainland. The typical duration of an exchange is one semester.",

  "text": "What is Product Carbon Footprint?\nCarbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, event or products, and is expressed as a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e). A carbon footprint accounts for all six Kyoto GHG emissions: \nCarbon Dioxide (CO2)\nMethane (CH4)\nNitrous oxide (N2O)\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)\nPerfluorocarbons (PFCs)\nSulphur Hexafluoride (SF6)\nThere are two main types of carbon footprint:\nOrganisational carbon footprint - A measure of GHG emissions from all the activities across the orgnisation including energy used in buildings, industrial processes and company vehicles, etc.\nProduct carbon footprint (PCF) - a measure of GHG emissions across the life of a particular product (goods or service) throughout its \"life cycle\", from the extraction of raw materials and manufacturing, distribution through to its use and end-of-life.\nKeywords: ISO 14067, PCF labeling, verification\nQuantification: A product carbon footprint offers a number of benefits, both in terms of differentiating the product or service assessed, and leading to better understand and manage your supply chains. \nCommunication: Communicating internally can lower energy cost, engage with employees and optimize processes; External communication can be mainly used in business to business companies and business to consumer orgnisaztions.\nInternational trend\nClimate change poses an enormous challenge for farmers in developing countries. In addition to adapting to changing climatic conditions, food exporters are increasingly being asked by retailers to measure and reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of their products. A product carbon footprint can help to differentiate your product or service and enhance your brand image As a result, new market requirements have emerged, mainly in the form of standards on PCF. \nThe growing trend of PCF standards is driven largely by retailers and several governments in developed and emerging economies. These standards can be classified into three main (though not mutually exclusive) groups based on their stakeholder involvement and pathways of development: International schemes: developed through international consultation with the involvement of stakeholders from public and private organisations, business, NGOs, academia, etc. \nClick here for the Product carbon footprint directory",

ISO14067 will support the assessment of life cycle GHG emissions of products, enable CFP to be reported and communicated to supply chains, consumers and other stakeholders, and provide a common basis for the comparison of results arising from the use of this standard.\nThe new standard builds largely on the existing ISO standards for life cycle assessments (ISO 14040/44) and environmental labels and declarations (ISO 14025) and is planned to be published by May, 2013. It currently bears Draft International Standard (DIS) status.

  "text": "Supply Chain Carbon management\nThe aim of Carbon Management was to help companies to understand systematically the business risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Carbon management can be implemented at the level of an individual company to the level of an end-to-end supply chain i.e. from raw materials to end consumer. \nIn this project, an advisory kit will developed to recommend proper carbon footprint supply chain management steps for SMEs. Manufacturers at different stages of the product supply chain will be selected: downstream (end product manufacturer) and upstream (component/part supplier). The feedback from these two manufacturers during the application will be used to refine the kit. Moreover, The case study results can be used by the downstream type SMEs to manage their suppliers to achieve lower end product carbon footprint and better environmental performance; and also the upstream manufacturers can follow the showcases to meet the upstream's requirements about carbon disclosure in accordance with ISO 14067. The schematic comparison of carbon management of individual company and carbon management across supply chain is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Schematic comparison of carbon management of individual company and carbon management across supply chain\nCarbon management of individual company\nThis is mirrored in the approaches of many of the leading companies we work with when they look for opportunities to improve their operations. For companies that recognize the need to reduce energy costs and to play their part in mitigation of climate change, integrated supply chain analysis is the next logical step in their efforts to reduce carbon emissions. \nManaging the carbon footprint of products across the supply chain is the next step for business to take in the effort to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. There are several issues driving business to take action, including:\nIncreases in direct energy costs and the energy costs of suppliers; \nExisting and planned legislation which penalises high energy consumption and rewards emissions reductions; \nChanging consumer attitudes to climate change, presenting forward-thinking companies with an opportunity to develop and market low-carbon products. \nThis supply chain approach has the potential to unlock significant emissions reductions and large financial benefits by reducing the carbon footprint at an individual product level. It can help individual companies to understand the carbon emissions across the supply chains in which they operate and allow them to prioritise areas where further reductions in emissions can be achieved. It can ultimately help all of business make better informed decisions in product manufacturing, purchasing, distribution and product development by considering the costs and liabilities that exist whenever carbon emissions are generated. This is the next step in the evolution of efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.",

  "text": "Sustainability reporting\nCorporate sustainability reporting has raised tremendous concerns as more and more companies' choice of international scheme, like implementing GRI framework, joining Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) or Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). Fortune 500 have played the leading role of this progress while more and more SMEs would like to disclose their company's environmental impact under marketing pressure. And now some companies have gone further, since not only carbon footprint at organizational level, but each product's carbon footprint is also focused in sustainable reporting. \nTake Apple for example. They have their first Product Environmental Report for iPhone 3G in June, 2008, and until now all currently provided Apple products have Product Environmental Reports, which can be viewed on their website. The reports are mainly focused on the following categories: climate change, energy efficiency, material efficiency, restricted substance and recycling. Except the restricted substance, others are linked by product carbon footprint. Four life stages of Apple's products have defined as Production, Customer use, Transport and Recycling. The below is the sample report of the NEW IPAD, the detail of which you can find by clicking the link. \n（http://images.apple.com/environment/reports/docs/iPad_Product_Environmental_Report_March2012.pdf） \nThe project can help \nyour company better understand requirements of carbon disclosure and completed CDP questionnaire to a level of quality required \nyour company obtain clear and effective reporting under Hong Kong industry and business conditions with years of carbon and SME project experience",

Through these high level consultancy services, KMIRC has helped various sectors ranging from public utilities, aviation, government, manufacturing, social work, printing and publishing, healthcare and more to kick-start and fine tune their KM journey yielding productivity enhancements, cost savings, innovations, as well as enhanced trust for knowledge sharing. \n1. Strategy formulation\nOne of the very first tasks in embarking on a KM journey is to define a strategy.\n2. KM Framework evaluation\nCreating a KM strategy is not a one-off event. A strategy needs to be re-calibrated from time to time taking into consideration of new developments and change in internal and external factors. Impact assessments and gap analysis need to be conducted.\n3. Knowladge System Evaluation and Assessment\nTechnology plays a key role in many KM processes and stages of a KM journey. After formulation of a KM strategy, many organisations proceed to adopt some kind of technologies to support and enhance their collaborations and knowledge sharing efforts.\n4. Information Classification and Knowladge Navigation\nWhen it comes to locating stored knowledge, knowledge workers adopt two common ways - search and navigation. In fact, searching and organising knowledge are intrinsically related. Taxonomy development and maintenance is an area in KM that is dedicated to the organisation and navigation of codified assets. Several departments have identified the need to create and maintain taxonomies.\nTypes of KM projects \nPeople & process-oriented KM initiatives\nCultural and Readiness Assessment\nFormulation of a KM Strategy, Framework & Strategic Planning\nKnowledge Audit & Knowledge Management Audit\nChange Management\nKM Assessment including the definition of metrics &\neporting of Intellectual Capital (IC)\nCommunity of Practices / Special Interest Groups (SIG)\nTechnology-oriented KM deployments\nSearch Engine configuration, testing & deployment\nTaxonomy development, maintenance & governance\nCollaboration System\nEnterprise Portal\nElectronic Document Management System (EDMS)\nKnowledge / Information Repositories\nContent Management System (CMS) & Applications (CMA)\nE-Learning\nIntelligent System\nBlogging / Weblogs / RSS Readers / Wikis\nOur customers\nGovernment\nArchitectural Services Department\nCensus and Statistics Department\nChild Assessment Services (CAS)\nCorrectional Services Department\nDepartment of Health Child Assessment Services\nDepartment of Health\nElectrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD)\nEnvironmental Protection Department\nFire Services Department\nHong Kong Post Office\nHousing Authority\nIntellectual Property Department\nOffice of the Government Chief Information Officer\nSocial Welfare Department\nThe Civil Services Training and Development Institute\nThe Hong Kong Council of Social Service\nThe Hong Kong Police Force\nThe Land Registry\nCompany/Society\nAutomated Systems Limited\nAvant Werx Pet Limited\nBank of China\nBaptist Oi Kwan Social Service\nBritish Academy of Management (BAM)\nBritish Council\nCanossa Hospital\nCathay Pacific\nCLP Power Hong Kong Limited\nCyberWisdom\nCystal Group\nCSC\nFamily Planning Association of Hong Kong\nFree Methodist Church\nGuangzhou Municipal Science & Technology Progress Fund\nHong Kong Dragon Airlines LImited\nHong Kong Electric\nHong Kong Red Cross\nInfocomm Development Authority (IDA)\nJardines IT Group\nJohnson Electric\nKnowledge Business Network Co.

There are two types of audit, one for structured and one for unstructured business process. They have been implemented in two public utility companies in Hong Kong.\nThe first audit was carried out in a power utility company which was also a MAKE Award winner. It basically compos of eight phases: (i) workﬂow study; (ii) preliminary process survey (iii) in- depth interviews (iv) construction of a knowledge inventory; (v) knowledge mapping; (vi) social network analysis(vii) SWOT analysis, followed by (viii) recommendations of knowledge management strategy. Based on the results of the knowledge audit, an appropriate KM strategy was drawn up to retain the knowledge that can be used for status review of other plant systems in the future, as well as to enhance knowledge sharing among diﬀerent departments.\nThe second audit was implemented in the marketing department of a gas utility company which was responsible for negotiation of contract requirements of company clients. The company faces the challenges to efficiently share their valuable knowledge and know-how with their counterparts in mainland China. The management is keen to see that the risk of knowledge loss is mitigated. Narrative circle was conducted to enable knowledge workers to discover implicit and explicit knowledge categories. Subsequently, respondents developed individual activity maps, which describe their job activities and stakeholder involvement in their work. By analysing the elicited knowledge and knowledge-activity map, the knowledge inventory, list of critical knowledge, and list of critical knowledge workers were identified. KM strategy was then formulated based on the derived results.\nThe experience gained from the two cases are compared and found to be useful to launch KM program in a company.\nFor further information on this project, you are welcome to contact the following:\nW.B.

For example, leakage of knowledge and loss of knowledge due to loopholes in information technology system and employee turnover respectively, affect the survival and sustainability of most businesses. To combat with knowledge risks, the Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Centre (KMIRC) develops a tool to assess the knowledge risk factors of companies systematically and reliably. There are two levels of assessment – Level 1 quick check-list type survey and Level 2 evidence-based validation. The assessment results from these two levels are then aggregated to produce a final knowledge risk factor score which would be useful for companies to formulate strategies to mitigate knowledge risks. The risk tool has been tested in various companies with positive feedback. A trial version of the Level 1 assessment can be accessed via https://goo.gl/forms/tyPU8snMjJlaB4Wq2",

Preferably, these proven practices should be novel ways to address a challenge you faced and solved.\nProven practices are methods that have been demonstrated to be effective and lend themselves to replication to other groups, organizations, and contexts.\nFor example, it could be how you found a novel way to further engage your employees to share their knowledge, or how you found a novel way to assess a large number of ideas suggested by employees, or anything related to KM or IM practices.\nAs part of the Global MIKE Award knowledge sharing and learning spirit, please be reminded that the two proven practices submitted will be later on shared with other Global MIKE Award winners (on a secure server). So please do not share any strategically sensitive proven practices, but still share some novel and useful ones. You will also be able to learn from other Global MIKE Award winners’ proven practices.",

  "text": "RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION\nRadio frequency identification (RFID) is an advanced automatic identification technology which, within its readable reach, can remotely read the required information from a tracked target attached to an RFID tag (usually information stored as a set of the unique electronic identification code used for identification and other information), without the need for a mechanical or an optical contact between the identification system and the RFID tag1. A typical RFID system consists of the following basic components: RFID tags (can be attached to the target to be tracked), an antenna, a reader and the host file system. After the data is read by the reader, it is transferred through an RFID middleware which brings greater ease with which the reader and other application software transfer the data and which makes communication between different readers and application software easier. Figure 1 shows a typical RFID system, and explains how each part operates to complement each other.\n1 林妍,「物聯網安全嗎?嬰兒監控器夜半 驚魂」,大紀元,2014 年 5 月 14 日。\nFigure 1: Basic components of a radio frequency identification system\nDifferent RFID frequencies are used in different uses, but can be broadly divided into the following categories: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), ultra-high frequency (UHF) and microwave. As for the types of RFID tags, categorisation is mainly dependent on its source of power, and there are three categories: active tags, battery-assisted passive tags and passive tags. Types of RFID tags, placement, type of material and tag orientation and polarization and reader antenna complexes and other factors will affect the read range, accuracy, and limit its application.\nCurrently, RFID is used in many ways, such as: the source-free RFID system that is used for patient monitoring, RFID-based intelligent transport systems application solutions, RFID-based residential district security systems, RFID access control systems and electronic traceability technology.\nIn 2006, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) began to value the standardization of RFID application systems, and have therefore provided a kind of framework for RFID application systems2. At present, RFID technology is ever-improving, and many protocol and standards that correspond to RFID technology have come into existence, such as, the air interface communication protocol, which standardises the exchange of information between readers and RFID tags, and makes interoperability and connectivity between devices from different manufacturers possible3.\n2 經濟部標準檢驗局,國家標準發展策略研 究計畫 國家標準發展策略 白皮書 ( 第 2 版 ),2007 年。\n3 郎為民,ISO/IEC 的 RFID 標準化進程, 武漢:解放軍通信指揮學院。\nDespite its very rapid development, RFID technology is still facing challenges and obstacles in terms of full application. With the widespread application of RFID technology, the sharing of RFID data has become more and more important, and so has the standardisation of data security. Misgivings about the safety of RFID-related data has limited the adoption of RFID technology.",

  "text": "CLOUD COMPUTING\nAccording to the definition from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)1, cloud computing is 'a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction'. With the increase in the volume of IoT business, the demand for data storage and computing capacity will continue to increase, thereby increasing the requirements for 'cloud computing' capabilities. \n1「IST 的雲計算計劃」,於:http://www. nist.gov/itl/cloud/index.cfm [ 於 2013 年 6 月7日]。 \nCloud computing model consists of the following components: five basic characteristics (on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource sharing, rapid elasticity, measurable service), three services model (Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)); and four deployment models (private cloud, community cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud). \nCloud computing technology allows network service providers to handle hundreds of millions of data in a very short time (a few seconds) within. Cloud computing users can use an ordinary PC, a phone, a tablet, etc., to complete the user needs to access and service (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Cloud Computing User Equipment\nAt present, cloud computing has spawned a variety of applications, such as, cloud-based business application security software, hardware, users, organisations, secure cloud platform (collectively: Cloud Security) and cloud storage. Through a large number of user-clients in a mesh network, cloud security monitors the behaviour of software on the network and gets the latest news on Trojan horses and malware, and sent to the server for automatic analysis and processing, then distributes viruses and Trojans solutions to each client. Cloud storage is a new concept extended from cloud computing, and refers to a system that provides access from the outside and to make business visits, using such functions as cluster applications, network technologies or a distributed document system in a co-operatively manner by software on different types of storage devices. Application of software together work to provide a system of external data storage and business access functions. In simpler terms, cloud storage is a new solution that puts the stored resources to be retrieved on the cloud at anytime, anyplace. Any device can be connected through a network connection to the cloud, and easily-accessible information. Other includes cloud-based applications computing technology: cloud call centre, cloud conference, cloud social networking and so on. \nIn China, applications using cloud computing technology are becoming more popular. An example is TOPSEC, a provider of information security products and services solutions, which has introduced the Yangzhou cloud security system solution based on the actual security needs of cloud computing centres coupled with its own experience in cloud security and its cloud security products. The Yangzhou cloud safety system has established a high-performing highly reliable, highly secure, easily managed, easy-to-expand cloud security platform, and through the cloud security management platform provides dynamic and flexible cloud computing security services for e-government cloud2. \n2沈余峰,「揚州政務雲成功案例」,雲安 全 -- 華麗大幕背後的危機,2013 年 4 月。\nWith the further development of cloud computing, cloud computing will be able to be used in more areas: \n1Medicine and healthcareThe information-centric application model that puts 'cloud information platform' as its core will enhance the ability of pharmaceutical companies to share information internally, as well as the overall service of public platforms to share medical information. 2ManufacturingCloud computing will help in the establishment of corporate cloud supply chain information platform, thereby accelerating the process of information integration of 'Development - Procurement - Production - Inventory - Sales'. 3Financial and energy sectorsCloud computing model will become the 'key weapon' in information integration in financial, energy and other large enterprises. 4E-governmentCloud computing will assist Chinese government of all levels to establish a 'public service platform'. 5Education and researchIn the future, cloud computing will provide a practical platform for research and development for universities and research institutes. 6TelecommunicationsChinese telecommunications enterprises will be able to gain sizable revenues from the provision of all kinds of paid cloud services and products. \nHowever, the development of cloud computing also faces many challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to prevent illegal usage of data stored by the cloud service providers, as well as to safeguard such information; Secondly, the question of how to change users' habits so that they are accustomed to using network-based hardware and software applications needs to be tackled; Thirdly, there is the question of network transfers and the lack of uniform technical standards. All these will pose serious challenges to the widespread adoption of cloud computing in the future3.\n3「IST 的雲計算計劃」,於:http://www. nist.gov/itl/cloud/index.cfm [ 於 2013 年 6 月 7 日 ]。",

Big data is characterised by 4'V's: volume, velocity, variety and veracity. \nBig data has become a popular concept that players in the computer industry are competing to grasp, and has even attracted the attention of the business and financial communities. If it can be said that IoT has provided the source of data and that cloud computing has provided channels to data storage and access, then big data can be understood as lending effective help to data application and decision-making, and big data has therefore become the 'inner soul technology' to IoT and cloud computing. \nIn IoT, with the widespread use of sensors and the wild popularity of mobile devices, sensors, the total amount of electronic information has seen an explosive growth worldwide. According to statistics from MIIT, the Chinese IOT industry was already worth more than 230 billion yuan in 2011, of which the sensor equipment market represented more than 90 billion yuan4. In the era of IoT, data can be divided into sensor data and social networking data. Currently, the amount of network data is still greater than the amount of data sensed by sensors. However, with the growing popularity of sensing devices and the gradual centralisation of sensing data, it is expected by 2015, the amount of sensing data will begin to exceed that of network data, and will eventually outgrow it by ten to twenty times5. \n4曾迺強,「中移動 4G 用戶數 今年衝 1 億」,經濟日報,2014 年 4 月 22 日。 \n5 賽迪顧問,「雲計算重點應用領域發展趨 勢」,2011 年 3 月。 \nTo realise the development of the IoT big data industry, work in the following three levels is necessary: First, solving time and cost issues that hinder the large-scale promotion of the IoT t through the establishment of a platform, a set of standards and economies of scale; secondly, solving the issues of value discovery and value re-creation encountered when putting IoT to use through the accumulation, sharing and analysis research techniques of big data; and finally, solving the issue of sustainable development of the industry through the reconstruction of the value chain to provide the required services for each participant in application6. \n6中國科學院自動化研究所,高科技與產業 化,第 204 期,2013 年 5 月號,頁 66- 69。",

  "text": "Near Field Communication (NFC), also known as short-range wireless communication, is a short-range high-frequency wireless communication technology which allows for contact-free point-to-point data transfer between electronic devices so that such devices can exchange information within a close range1. This technology evolved from non-contact RFID and was jointly developed by Philips Semiconductors (now NXP Semiconductors), Nokia and Sony on the basis of RFID and interconnection technologies.\n15 聯網,「什麼是 NFC ? NFC 概念簡介」, 於:http://www.5lian.cn/html/2012/ gainianjiexi_0213/30054.html [於2013年 9月6日]。 \nNFC has three operating modes, namely the reader/writer mode, card emulation mode and peer-to-peer mode. The reader/writer mode enables the device to be used as a non-contact card reader, such as, one installed on smart posters or electronic labels on information panel at an exhibition, which reads relevant information. The card emulation mode is analogous to an IC card that uses RFID technology, and can replace a large number of the existing IC cards, such as, credit cards, access cards, transport tickets and service tickets. The peer-to-peer mode links two NFC-enabled devices to rapidly exchange information over a short distance (peer-to-peer transmission), such as, downloading music, exchange images or synchronising contacts on the address books.\nNFC is characterised by its low cost, convenience and intuitive usage, making it bear additional potential in certain areas. NFC is suitable for a wide range of scenarios: merchants can use NFC and combine it with e-coupons, loyalty cards and various payment options to expand and enhance customers' shopping experience; the NFC technology can also be used in marketing, leaving a far-reaching impact on modern marketing; NFC can also allow for data interchange between electronic devices which can be in a non-contact and rapid manner to exchange information and other content; NFC is even a technology suitable for access control systems and other safety equipment. \nIn order to promote the development and popularisation of NFC, the industry created a non-profit standards organisation named the NFC Forum to facilitate the implementation and standardisation of NFC technology, and to ensure synergy between devices and services. The NFC Forum has a few hundred members worldwide, including Sony, Philips, LG, Motorola, NXP Semiconductors and Samsung, among others. Chinese members include China Mobile, Huawei, ZTE and other companies. \nWith the maturing of the NFC technology, the public push for NFC adoption is also increasing. However, NFC encounters many obstacles on its path of development, among them is the apparent shortfall of the current technological craftsmanship with respect to the widespread adoption of the NFC technology. Many considerations need to be taken into account in designing and manufacturing labels, such as, the need to ensure that the label can be mass-produced at very low cost while maintaining the level of performance. In designing labels, three key performance parameters and those elements need to be considered: the speed of data retrieval, the size of the chip and unit prices. Failure to solve these problems on design and manufacturing will hinder the further promotion of NFC2.\n2王忍成,「使用 NFC 手機進行密碼管理及 登入」,101 學年度資訊專題成果報告書, 國立臺東大學資訊工程學系, 2013年1月。",

  "text": "INDUSTRY 4.0 AND INTERNET OF THINGS\nThe first industrial revolution that began in the 18th century ushered in the age of steam and the accompanying developments. Starting from the 1870s, the world was entering the second industrial revolution—electrification. For the third industrial revolution in the 1940s and 1950s, the main goal was automation. Since 2011, with the development of popular domains, such as, big data and cloud computing, industrial revolution has entered a phase of transitioning from automation to smart processes1. In 2011, the concept of 'Industrie (Industry) 4.0' was first proposed by three professors at the Hannover Messe in Germany. In April 2013, the German government officially adopted 'Industry 4.0' as one of the ten Future Projects in Germany's 'High-Tech Strategy 2020'. Subsequently, policies such as 'Advanced Manufacturing' in the United States, 'Made in China 2025' in China, 'Factory 2050' in the United Kingdom, and 'Productivity 4.0' in Taiwan were introduced. These policies emphasise the importance and necessity of industrial transformation to reform, and the conversion to smart processes is the core of 'Industry 4.0'. \n1馮甜,「工業4.0对制造業带来的變革和思考」,博客,2017 年 12 月 29 日。 \nDifferent from the previous three industrial revolutions, 'Industry 4.0' is no longer limited to invention itself. What it emphasises to a greater degree is the integration of technologies - combining information and communication technologies with the virtual world of cyberspace to create a highly flexible and personalised model of survival and to restructure the industrial chain. 'Industry 4.0' is based on the Cyber-Physical System (CPS), with four 'smarts' (smart factories, smart manufacturing, smart logistics and smart services) as the theme, with three major integrations (vertical integration, horizontal integration and end-to-end integration) as the goals to be achieved, three scenarios (products, facilities, management) are proposed. Figure 1 will list out each point1. \nFigure 1: Main content of 'Industry 4.0'\nIndustry 4.0 points to a new phase for the current development and IIoT is a mean to achieve smart manufacturing. The IIoT emphasises the use of IIoT technologies in the industrial sector and is welcomed by governments, enterprises and organisations. The architecture of a typical industrial IIoT system consists of four different processing layers: the device layers, the network (connection) layers, the service layers, and the content (manage) layers2. The functions at each level are shown in Figure 2. The technologies involved in each layer will be introduced one by one later. \n2張程、楊冬菊, 「物聯網系列二：體系架構」\nFigure 2: Architecture of an Industrial IoT System\nAs an inter-disciplinary scientific research field, the application of IIoT relies on the following six key technologies (Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Six key technologies of IoT\nAs far as current technology development is concerned, the application of IIoT is mainly concentrated in the following aspects (Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Applications of IIoT",

  "text": "LOW POWER WIDE AREA NETWORK\nLPWAN is a wireless network technology that uses low bit rate for long-distance communication. The LPWAN has a transmission speed of between 0.3 kbit/s and 50 kbit/s per channel. The most salient features of this technology are low energy consumption, low cost and support for long-distance data transmission. Therefore, it can meet the operational needs of IoT devices on city levels. It is suitable for the domains of low-frequency data transmission, such as, environment monitoring, vehicular fleet management, smart parking and water pipes detection. However, LPWAN also has its drawbacks. For example, its transmission speed is very slow; some technologies limit the update frequency of communication, so it is not always possible to complete information transmission. This section describes the three technologies with the highest penetration rate in the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN): 'SIGFOX', 'LoRa' and 'NB-IoT'1. \n1蕭佑和,「萬物聯網，淺談IoT低功耗廣域網路趨勢：LoRa、SIGFOX、NB-IoT」,博客,2018 年 1 月 28 日。\n1SIXFOX1,2,3 \nSIGFOX is the technology with the lowest transmission speed among low-power WAN technologies. Its transmission speed is only 100 bits/s; also, each device can transmit only up to 140 messages per day and the payload of each message cannot exceed 12 bytes. The advantages of such configuration include : saving a great amount of power consumed by the device and the possibility of allocating bandwidth to more devices under the same network construction at the same time. At present, a single SIGFOX base station can be connected to up to 1 million devices. This is very important to the IoT, which is established by a large number of devices. SIGFOX currently uses the Sub-1 GHz ISM band for communication. This communication frequency band is an unlicensed frequency band. Users do not need to apply for permits or pay fees. They only need to comply with certain transmission power (generally less than 1W), and do not cause interference to other frequency bands. The biggest feature of SIGFOX is that it focuses on a single operator (SIGFOX Network Operator, SNO), providing services in a region and establishing the same IoT network worldwide. \n2李一詩,「物聯網重點技術 LPWAN 解析，6大主要技術、各家優勢與產業發展、商業模式與智慧城市應用」,博客,2017 年 3 月 2 日。\n3李文恩,「低功耗廣域網路串起物聯網裝置（4）：Sigfox」,博客,2017 年 3 月 31 日。\n2LoRa1,2,4 \nThe LoRa name originated from 'Long Range', which indicates that this technology can support communications over extremely long distances. Although its communication distance is slightly shorter than SIGFOX, its transmission bandwidth is higher. In addition to being capable of one-way communication transmission like SIGFOX, it can also execute two-way data exchange. LoRa divides communication transmission into three different classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C by power consumption and transmission speed. The Class A method saves the most power, but the latency in data download is relatively noticeable. Most network systems nowadays use a mesh topology, but LoRa uses a star topology to reduce the complexity and power consumption of the overall network. Like SIGFOX, LoRa uses unlicensed bands. However, unlike SIGFOX which adopts an operational mode in which network is provided exclusively by a single operator in an area, LoRa allows anyone to set up a base station to build a network environment. With more than 500 members now, LoRa is the most sought-after LPWAN technology.\n4李文恩,「低功耗廣域網路串起物聯網裝置（2）：LoRa」,博客,2017 年 3 月 21 日。\n3NB-IoT1,2,5 \nNB-IoT, or Narrow Band Internet of Things in full name, is a narrowband radio communication technology designed specifically for IoT devices. The biggest difference between NB-IoT and SIGFOX and LoRa is that it transmits data using licensed frequency bands, which are the same communication bands as the ones used by ordinary mobile phones. The advantage is that the signal is relatively stable and not susceptible to interference, which can reduce communication latency, ensure data security and maintain a high level of network transmission quality. The excellent service quality of NB-IoT makes it suitable to be used in involving financial and security, such as, monitoring banking facilities, alarm systems, health/medical applications, etc.\nAnother difference among NB-IoT and SIGFOX and LoRa is that NB-IoT does not need to re-establish the network and base station because it is compatible with the base stations of 4G LTE mobile communication. In other words, if an area is covered by 4G LTE mobile communication, there is no need to set up a dedicated base station. However, the cost of NB-IoT is higher than SIGFOX and LoRa and fees are incurred when each device is for executing data communication. Therefore, NB-IoT is more suitable for tracking goods with high prices or applications that are directly related to consumers. \n5李文恩,「低功耗廣域網路串起物聯網裝置（3）：NB-IoT」,博客,2017 年 3 月 24 日。",

  "text": "Prof. Adam T. Clare\nMetal additive manufacturing (AM) has rapidly become an important research topic, but also an underpinning technology for a range of emergent research fields. From humble beginnings driven by crude machine tools to sophisticated, robotised production systems; metal AM has moved away from a laboratory peculiarity towards an established production technique. So what next?\nThis talk will explore AM research activity from within my team relating to the key challenge areas in my view (materials, processes and design) which will drive this technology forwards over the next ten years. We will examine the shortfalls in our knowledge and the physical phenomena that must be mastered in order exploit the full potential of these technologies. Through new insight to the processes-material interaction coupled to design and more established technologies there is hidden capability awaiting our attention.\nDiscussion will conclude with a personal view of the materials and manufacturing challenges that face humanity as developed nations enact ‘net-zero’ manifestos. The role manufacturing technology will play in delivering net zero cannot be overstated as we approach a nexus of excess demand for materials and energy. It is apparent that we are yet to devise the building block technologies that will allow us to thrive under increasingly challenging conditions. We will dedicate some time to consider a vision for manufacturing in 2050 and the level of resilience that will be required to maintain and perhaps enhance our way of life.\nRecent publications\nA.

Clare\nProfessor of Manufacturing Engineering, \nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, \nThe University of British Columbia, Canada.\nI am currently a Professor of Manufacturing Engineering at the University of British Columbia and hold the Rolls-Royce/Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair at the University of Nottingham, UK where I worked since 2010 before joining BC. I have had Fellowships during this time at various research centres of excellence including University of Tokyo, AMRC/MTC and a secondment to Rolls-Royce Submarines. My research focuses on the use of non-traditional manufacturing methods to arrive at net shape while inducing favourable material properties. I am particularly interested in developing new manufacturing methods and materials for use in the high value manufacturing sectors including aerospace, tooling, and biomedical engineering. In these competitive markets product differentiation is often directly linked to additional functionality or performance. Through the development of new manufacturing technologies and materials my team endeavours to deliver this. I currently have Editorial roles with the Journal of Materials Processing Technology (subject editor), Manufacturing Letters (Editorial board) and the International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture (reviewing committee).\nI am also a Founder, Director and Scientific Advisor to Texture Jet Ltd and Scintam Engineering Ltd which are University spin out companies. Through 'TJ' and ‘Scintam’ we are exploiting technology developed from within our team for customers predominantly in the aerospace sector",

It contains some key principles, most notably:\nKnowledge Assets can have considerable value and impact beyond their original purpose and exploiting this is part of good asset management. This value can be social, economic, and financial, and is often a combination of these. Knowledge Assets can be measured.\nRon Young will propose that it is now becoming mandatory for many organisations, public and private, to manage their knowledge assets. Furthermore, those organisations that manage their knowledge assets wisely, will be leaders in the 21st Century knowledge driven economies, institutions, and professions around the world.\nThe webinar on “Understanding and Exploiting Knowledge Asset Management?” is co-organised by the Hong Kong Knowledge Management Society and Behavior and Knowledge Engineering Research Centre (BAKE) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\nYou may replay the Seminar and search video via the link provided below:\nhttps://youtu.be/M4aa3HQIrZw",

  "text": "Source: SoL, Society of Learning Organization\nChris Argyris (1923 –2013)\nOn November 16th, Chris Argyris died peacefully, surrounded by his family after living a full and meaningful life. During his 90 years, Chris served in World War II, produced over 30 books and 150 articles, taught at Yale’s School of Management and at Harvard’s Business School and Graduate School of Education, served on the Boards of the Monitor Group and Greenwich Research Associates, and earned 14 honorary doctorates. He leaves behind a body of work and a community of inquiry that will forever shape how we think about leaders, organizations, theory-building, research, and practice. \nAs the father of organizational learning, Chris exemplified what he taught: the curiosity and courage it takes to sustain learning, even in the face of threat; the hope and humility it takes to create a better world; and the unbounded generativity and generosity it takes not just to create new ideas, but to forge collaborations across disciplines and to mentor a wide range of scholars and practitioners. \nBut it was Chris’s unique ability to empathize with people’s experiences and circumstances—while still holding them accountable for changing them—that affected me most. This was his ticket into the hearts and minds of thousands of people around the world—government and corporate leaders, students, professors, and colleagues alike. \nIt certainly was for me. Thirty-five years ago, while looking at a catalogue for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where Chris was teaching at the time, my father noticed Chris’s name.\n\"Chris Argyris? Chris Argyris?” he asked excitedly. \"He teaches there?”\n\"It looks that way,” I said, unaware of the name and surprised by the reaction. \n\"Well, you have to take his course. He was one of only three consultants who came through IBM that I had the greatest respect for. He’s absolutely brilliant.”\nThat coming from my father was exceptionally high praise. As a member of IBM’s Management Committee in the 1960s, he had the highest standards when it came to rigor, thought, and excellence. \nCurious, I asked: \"So who are the other two?”\n\"Jay Forrester and Herb Simon.”\nOver the next three decades, I came to fully appreciate why my Dad reacted the way he did, and in what fine company he had placed Chris.\nI like to think of Chris now in that kind of company, along with his most generative collaborator, Don Schön, with whom he wrote the seminal books, Theory in Practice (1974) and Organizational Learning (1978). I can just see him—a broad smile lighting his face, eyes full of curiosity—asking the unexpected question, listening for a toehold to advance learning, and not stopping until something new comes of it.\nChris leaves behind his beloved wife of 63 years, Renee, and his talented and devoted children, Dianne and Phil, two apples who did not fall far from the tree (read their tribute).\nSoL, Society for Organizational Learning",

  "text": "Java User Groups and the Java Community Process: A winning combination\nDATE : August 21 , 2014 \nVENUE : Room M111, Floor 1, Core M, PolyU Campus \nORGANIZER(S) : Java User Group \nREMARK(S) : Abstract:\nThe success of the Java language and platform depends on community support and participation. Java is developed through the Java Community Process, which is open to all members of the Java community. Recent and ongoing changes to the process (\"JCP.Next\") make it even easier for developers to observe and to participate in the work of the JCP.\nThanks to the efforts of two JUGs who serve on the JCP's Executive Committee (SouJava and the London Java Community) we are discovering new ways to build on the energy, enthusiasm, and expertise of the JUG community in order to further advance the Java platforms.\nMost developers understand the value of participating in open-source projects. In this talk I will explain how the JCP is is organized and how Java standards are developed. I will discuss the current state of the Java platforms, explain how the JCP is helping to evolve them, provide practical advice on how you can participate through your local Java User Group, and explain why participation in the JCP is good for your career.\nBring your questions, your suggestions, and your concerns. We want to hear from you - the foundation of the Java community - and to explore new ideas for community participation. \nSpeaker Biography:\nPatrick Curran is Chair of the Java Community Process organization. In this role he oversees the activities of the JCP's Program Management Office including evolving the process and the organization, managing its membership, guiding specification leads and experts through the process, chairing Executive Committee meetings, and managing the JCP.org web site.\nPatrick has worked in the software industry for more than 25 years, and at Sun and then Oracle for 20 years. He has a long-standing record in conformance testing, and before joining the JCP he led the Java Conformance Engineering team in Sun's Client Software Group. He was also chair of Sun's Conformance Council, which was responsible for defining Sun's policies and strategies around Java conformance and compatibility.\nPatrick has participated actively in several consortia and communities including the W3C (as a member of the Quality Assurance Working Group and co-chair of the Quality Assurance Interest Group), and OASIS (as co-chair of the Test Assertions Guidelines Technical Committee). Patrick's blog is here.\nSeminar on Internet of Things (IoT) Application for Smart City\nDATE : August 8, 2014 \nVENUE : Room CF401, Core F, PolyU Campus \nORGANIZER(S) : - Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\n- Sino Parking Services Limited, Sino Group \nCO-ORGANIZER(S) : - \nREMARK(S) : The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Sino Parking Services Limited (SPSL) jointly organize a seminar.

KE’s primary area of study and domain of action are the design and support of self-organising knowledge “ecosystems,” in which information, ideas, insights, and inspiration cross-fertilize and feed one another, free from the constraints of geography and schedule.\nThis talk will address:\nAn intelligence-based view of the firm\nHow AI tools may power up the Collective Intelligence Enhancement Lab (CIEL) and related knowledge systems technologies\nWhat next-generation learning organisations need to learn to make themselves more fully available to the benefit of AI-Enhanced Knowledge Ecosystems.\nThe talk will be highly interactive. It will outline the core idea of a current research project and provide space for exploring some of the “collective intelligence” distinctions in action.\nRecommended reading:\nNurturing Systemic Wisdom through Knowledge Ecology\nFrom Right Mindfulness to Collective Intelligence to Collective Sentience\nGeorge’s Bio\nGeorge Pór is a mentor & strategic learning partner to visionary leaders in business, civil society and national and international government agencies. He is the Managing Director of the London-based Community Intelligence transformation agency and faculty member at Meridian University.\nHe is a pioneer of collective intelligence research and the founder of Enlivening Edge, the online magazine and media hub of next-stage organisations, an invited presenter at IKMAP2018, an invited speaker at the 2nd China Organisational Evolution Forum, Shanghai, Nov 2-3, 2018.\nGeorge’s past academic posts included: California Institute of Integral Studies, INSEAD, London School of Economics, UC Berkeley, University of Amsterdam, University of Ottawa, University of Paris.\nHis present research focus is: Action Research for AI-augmented Collective Intelligence for Reinventing Organizations.\nHe likes to co-create his talks with his audience and accepts related questions emailed in advance.

Value creation in the networked economy is very much based on the creation and exchange of information and knowledge among the relevant parties. This talk will explore the impact of digitalisation on the field of knowledge management and foreshadow fruitful areas of research and practices in the decades to come.\nProfessor and Director\nKMIRC of PolyU\nProf Tsui joined Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) in 1989 after years of academic research in automated knowledge acquisition, natural language processing, case-based reasoning and knowledge engineering tools. His research strengths include cloud-based business innovation and knowledge services. He has also consulted for many government departments and private organizations in different countries. Prof Tsui is an honorary advisor of KM to the Police College, Hong Kong Police Force. He is a recipient of the KM Leadership Award and KM and Intellectual Capital Excellence Award in 2014 and 2015 respectively.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSuccessful Corporate Innovation\nIn this talk, Liam will talk about how an incumbent bank is looking to transform itself in the face of a rapidly changing landscape. Liam will outline some of the lessons learned from several years of driving corporate innovation programs, and the importance that principles like Design Thinking play driving innovation in banking.\nMr Liam Gilligan \nHead\nStandard Chartered Banks Hong Kong eXellerator\nLiam Gilligan is the Head of Standard Chartered Banks Hong Kong eXellerator, SCB’s innovation lab setup to accelerate development of customer centric solutions. Liam is an experienced business innovator, with 15 years’ experience across both startup and large corporate in innovation, product development, business development, strategy, and human centered design.\nPrior to joining Standard Chartered, Liam ran the Innovation Lab for Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Hong Kong. Before CBA, Liam was the General Manager of Service Product Innovation at Telstra, Australia’s largest Telco. Liam was responsible for developing and testing new business models, products and services. Liam also ran Service Design and Operations for Telstra’s retail footprint and was product lead for several new service businesses in the Telstra portfolio.\nBefore Telstra, Liam led Business Development, Product Development and Operations at Gizmo, an IT services startup, which appeared twice in BRW fast starters list.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKnowledge Elicitation and Mapping in the Cynefin Framework\nHow do we organize, analyze and make sense of the external world depends strongly how do we perceive the problem. The way knowledge is mapped and represented depends on the underlying causality that is either known, predictable, complicated or complex. The Cynefin framework developed by David J. Snowden categorize four domains of phenomenon based on our perception of the cause and effect . In the 1st domain, the cause and effect is repeatable and predictable. The knowledge needed to make the decision can be often represented by concept maps as best practices. In the 2nd domain where the cause and effect could be separated over space and time, the knowledge can be best represented by cyclic concept maps, which is also known as a causal loop diagram in systems thinking. In the 3rd domain, the cause and effect becomes coherent retrospectively and not repeatable (same input could yield different output), no standard mapping is possible and sense making methodology is advocated instead. Three cases on various projects are illustrated.\nDr Jessica Yip\nDr Jessica Yip obtained her PhD from PolyU and had worked in KMIRC on various knowledge audit projects in many sectors from transportation to public utility.\nAbout the Workshop\nLego Serious Play\nIf people and innovation is the key to an organization’s success, how an organization can create an environment that employees live innovation in their daily work? How we can use game to create group value and build collaborative working style, and the most important is how to sustain new behavior to become an organization new culture and strategy?\nThe half day workshop will introduce Lego Serious Play and let you experience the tool, a new way of communication, unlock players’ new knowledge through touching, looking and listening. It will be a fun and serious gamification journey for everyone to reflect or apply the results on your work or self-development.\nMs Debbie Hui\nTraining and Development Manager\nKuehne & Nagel Limited\nHelping people to help themselves is what Debbie did in the past 15 years in Asia market.

More than 75% of GDP in the developed markets including Hong Kong are produced by services. Service innovation in both services and manufacturing sectors is shaping up as a significant transformational force in these developed economies. Accordingly, firms in developed markets are becoming service centered, and focused on enhancing the customer experience. Service centered firms often co-create value with their customers through the dynamic configuration of their people (knowledge), processes and technologies which, collectively, are known as organizational capabilities.",

A recent Harvard Business Review publication noted: “Chance encounters and interactions between knowledge workers improve performance’” and research suggests some organisations are changing working environments and patterns in order to accommodate this. But are they doing enough to take their staff with them though or do their people merely see this as an attempt to cut cost and reduce the number of desks? \nWorkshop Objective:\n1 To demonstrate why space matters for collaboration, innovation and knowledge transfer.\n2 To share experiences and learn from each other.\n3 To consider current and future use of space in your workplace.\nThis interactive workshop will show how organisations as diverse as Standard Chartered, Pringle, Asian Development Bank, dotDigital and Google use space and objects to stimulate collaboration, innovation and knowledge sharing. And it will examine the concept of Orchestrated Serendipity.\nAttendees will be invited to share experiences and take away new ideas on how to make effective use of space.",

  "text": "KMP Gathering and Talk on Knowledge Risk and its Management\n13 Jan 2018 - 13 Jan 2018\n2pm – 4pm\nRoom BC404, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nMiss Haley TSANG\nPlease view here for more details\nSharing on knowledge risk and its management\nMost Knowledge Management (KM) programs emphasize on the importance of capturing, retaining and sharing of organizational knowledge among its stakeholders. As the benefits of these processes could not be realized in the short term, the senior management often has a lack of sense of urgency to plan and launch KM. To overcome this, another approach could be the assessment of knowledge risk and its disastrous effects on the daily operation of a company. Knowledge risk refers to the potential threats caused by improper management of knowledge. For example, leakage of trade secrets to outsiders and loss of critical knowledge because of system security problem and employee turnover respectively may negatively affect the reputation or even the competitiveness of companies. A risk tool has been developed by the Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Centre (KMIRC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to assess the knowledge risk factors of companies systematically and reliably. It has been tested in various companies with encouraging results and feedback, thus promising to move KM to more business territories. In this session, Haley will briefly share her master research on knowledge risk as well as the risk tool developed.\nBiography\nMiss Haley TSANG\nHaley is currently a PhD student at The University of Hong Kong. She recently graduated from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University with a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) and holds a double degree – BEng (Hons) and BBA (Hons) from the same university. During her study, she obtained several scholarships and was listed on the Dean’s Honours List of Outstanding Students. In 2016, she was awarded with the best paper and presentation in the PhD and Masters Colloquium in the 8th European Conference on Intellectual Capital. Her research interests include risk management, knowledge management and intellectual capital.",

  "text": "23 Oct 2017 - 23 Oct 2017\n3:45pm - 5:15pm\nBC402, PolyU\nDr Bonnie Cheuk\nAbout the Seminar:\nTitle: Who cares about information literacy in the workplace? \nThe ability to identify the need for information, to access, to effectively use and present information - from an individual or a group perspective - is critical for any knowledge worker to be effective in the workplace. Business executives strongly support the idea that knowledge workers need to continue to develop themselves, to further understand external customers' (or internal customers') needs, to draw on information and personal/collective experience to make decisions and present ideas. Information literacy enables employees to effectively undertake these activities and fulfil business goals.\nHowever, if information literacy is so important, why do we commonly hear only of the need to upgrade employees' leadership, communication, time management, project management, team management, lean/six sigma or digital skills, but rarely hear of employees being encouraged to attend \"information literacy\" professional development course? \nDoes that mean information literacy is unimportant? Or do business leaders assume that all employees are equipped with information literacy skills from the education system? Do business leaders expect their employees to acquire information literacy skills on the job?\nIn this presentation, Bonnie will introduce a refined, perhaps controversial, definition of information literacy in the workplace: \"The phase Information Literacy does not mean anything to knowledge workers; IL are disguised within different functional labels, and business processes which are specific to the business context\". \nDrawing on her wide experience helping global companies and senior executives establishing information/knowledge management strategy to become knowledge-driven companies, Bonnie concludes that the embeddedness of information in the business context makes it impossible to talk about \"information\" or \"information literacy\" out of context. This make the promotion of information literacy in the workplace extremely difficult (but not impossible)! \nThrough three angles, Bonnie will highlight why information literacy have not gained much traction in the workplace context. If information professionals are aware of the challenges, we are in a better position to make a difference. \nThink about knowledge workers working in these functions: R&D, innovation, sales, marketing, client services, IT support, product management, business analysis, they have to interact with information to carry out their work. Information literacy is obviously needed. IL is \"hidden\" in their respective function labels. \nKnowledge workers face different demands at work at different times - ranging from the need to \"drive efficiency/reduce costs\" vs \"increase effectiveness\" vs \"innovate\" vs \"handle crisis situation\" - and in different context, information is defined and handled in different ways. There is no one-size-fit-all information literacy process/tools that work under all business scenarios. \nThe level of information literacy exhibited in a workplace is highly influenced by the company culture. Whilst organisations with open, networked culture value information literacy, those with hierarchical, command-and-control culture would not value information literacy as much.\nBonnie will share some real-life examples as to how information literacy can be introduced in disguised under the \"change management\" banner, focussing on delivery business-driven strategy and outcomes, helping employees to self-discover why and how they need to interact with information in their specific business context in order to deliver their business goals. Recommendations as to what IL practitioners, researchers and policy makers can consider to develop IL programmes in the workplace will be shared.\nSo who cares about information literacy in the workplace? Business executives who want to build information-driven business do, although they are not familiar with the IL label. Information professionals do, and we need to find a way to build the bridges and engage with the business in a language that they can understand. IL professionals are facing some serious threats and opportunities to make information literacy come to life in the workplace context. \nJoin Bonnie to reflect on the issues together.\nNote: This presentation was first delivered as a keynote to kick off the European Conference on Information Literacy ECIL2017 in Sept 2017. The content is based on a book chapter titled \"The hidden value of information literacy in the workplace context: how to unlock and create business value\" in the \"Information Literacy in the Workplace, edited by Marc Forster, published by Facet Publishing in Apr 2017. \nAbout the Speaker:\nDr Bonnie Cheuk\nGlobal Head of Digital, Knowledge and Collaboration\nEuroclear\nBonnie Cheuk is a strategic, hands-on, business & results-driven executive with strong digital transformation, web/digital channel management, information & knowledge management, collaboration, social media and Enterprise 2.0 expertise. Originally from Hong Kong, she has 20+ years of international work experience with multinational corporations in HK, Singapore, USA, UK and Europe. \nHer expertise lies in blending her deep understanding of information/knowledge management, change management, communication/facilitation principles and practices with her knowledge of the latest technologies to deliver business solutions and drive change. She has led the successful roll out of social collaboration and knowledge sharing programmes for Euroclear, Citigroup and ERM.\nBonnie is partnering with the business and technology leaders to shape the future Digital Workplace experience for employees, and refreshing the web, social media, digital strategy to improve client experience for a global financial services company.\nBonnie’s doctorate research focussed on understanding the information seeking and use behaviour in the workplace context. Since then, she has developed strong interest in bringing information literacy to life in the workplace context.

This seminar will discuss ways in which a gamification strategy can encourage greater engagement and thereby community development. Onboarding into new community groups and spaces can be slow and frustrating. A well planned gamification layer has the potential to showcase the benefits of membership and decrease the time to active engagement. In an attention economy, new or reinvigorating communities need to work quickly to create a critical mass of membership, resources and rich dialogue. You have to look successful to be successful! Gamification could support rapid growth in professional learning contexts by employing strategies beyond the obvious trappings of competition (points and badges).\nCome along to discuss gamification mechanics, rewards, microcredentials, tools and technologies that could benefit your community cultivation efforts.\nDr Bronwyn Stuckey, Director of Innovative Educational Ideas and Research Fellow at Arizona State University Center for Games and Impact.\nConsultant Specialist in Game Play, Gamification, Communities of Practice and Learning Communities.\nBronwyn has been engaged in educational community and games in learning development for the past 15 years.

However, little is known about how to create sustainable ehealth services. By nature, the healthcare domain is characterized by problems with compliance and tensions among stakeholders. Further, services involve complex interactions that engage people as well as systems within which technology plays an important role. Creating services that are truly sustainable presents additional challenges. Traditional development approaches are insufficient to deal with these circumstances. This surfaces a wide range of issues with associated research opportunities. This seminar will seek to explore concepts and remove uncertainties towards sustainable ehealth service creation using examples in Chinese contexts.\nBiography of the Speaker\nDoug Vogel is Professor of Information Systems (IS) and an Association for Information Systems (AIS) Fellow as well as AIS Past President and, currently, Director of the eHealth Research Institute as a State Specially Recruited Expert in the School of Management at the Harbin Institute of Technology in China. He has published widely and been recognized as the most-cited IS author in Asia Pacific. His research interests reflect a concern for encouraging efficient and effective utilization of computer systems in an atmosphere conducive to enhancing the quality of life with particular attention to healthcare and wellness.\nInterested KMIRC members, please send an email with your name and email address to Miss Trista Lai at trista.lai@polyu.edu.hk for registration.",

  "text": "Evolution of Semantic Technologies in Scientific Libraries\n01 Mar 2016 - 01 Mar 2016\n6:30-8:30pm\nRoom BC308, 3/F, Core C, PolyU\nProf. Klaus Tochtermann\nFree for KMIRC Members\nPlease click here for registration.\nThis talk presents our experience with the evolution of semantic technologies in scientific libraries. Starting with semantic document representations and the use of semantic technologies to cross-link digital libraries, the talk will put its main focus on the question how deep web content can be brought to the surface web. \nIt is widely known that much of the web content is hidden in the so-called deep web. That is content is hidden in protected databases which cannot be harvested by any web search engine. At the same time, scholarly communication has changed dramatically. The new attitude can be best described as “What I do not find with Google or Google Scholar does not exist”. This however puts scientific libraries under pressure as much of their content (be it metadata or the publication itself) is stored in deep web databases. \nAs of today, query interfaces (HTML forms) provide access to most content in the deep web. Several approaches try to improve access to deep web content focusing on automatic query interface understanding. In contrast to this approach, this talk suggests to change the perspective. In our notion, it is in the interest of scientific libraries to provide controlled access to their deep web content through query interfaces. The talk therefore suggests the provision of semantic annotations for query interfaces. To realize a semantic annotation for query interfaces it is most important to find a generic model that is capable to formalize the variety of dependencies and restrictions of related form fields as well as the output data properties. Based on schema.org, the talk will propose a RDF vocabulary which can meet these requirements. It ensures the necessary abstraction level and serves as intermediate vocabulary connecting various other RDF vocabularies. The application of the vocabulary will be illustrated within the context of EconBiz which is maintained by ZBW and which one of the world’s largest digital library for economics.",

Recently scientists begin to realize that there are many relationships and coincident events that are not down to chance alone. The process that new knowledge can be discovered and accelerated from the mining of what seemingly unrelated information and patterns is a fascinating and challenging research. Success of chance discovery depends on the dynamic clustering and interactions of a huge amount of human, physical and digital resources.

  "text": "Mindful lunch\nOur First Mindful Lunch\n29 Oct 2013 - 29 Oct 2013\nKMIRC Colleagues\nIn modern busy life, we seldom pay attention to the things we are doing if this is not connected with solving our perceived problems. We always have something to do, something in mind, and somewhere to go. \nIt will be nice for us to pause for a while, relax and open our mind together. In order to develop our capacity to search inside ourselves, KMIRC organized a mindful lunch recently. \nWe brought our own food and kept silent during eating so that we could be mindful of our eating with our heart and feel the companion of colleagues around us without diverting our attention and to labor what to speak. A bell rang every 15 minutes to remind us to keep golden silence. All our colleagues enjoyed the peace of their heart and felt the taste of the food with their heart, accompanied by a beautiful melody of “Happiness is here and now”.

In the first hour, Sunny Chan, the leader of Hong Kong Java User Group will repeat the talk he has given in JavaOne 2011.\nAlthough the JVM abstracts developers from the hardware the Java program runs on, the underlying platform — including operating systems and hardware — can have a significant impact in a high-performance, low-latency environment. This session examines how in extreme cases, we can make use of Linux performance tools along with JVM performance tools to improve the performance and latency of the application. It presents an example in Linux to demonstrate how Java profiling tools can be used to identify the high-latency portion of the application and make use of Linux profiling tools such as oprofile to further identify the opportunity to optimize at the operating system/hardware level.",

So where do developers turn for the toolkits that will make them productive and effective in the cloud? \nFor Java, the answer is jclouds. \nApache jclouds is an open source library that helps you get started in the cloud and utilizes your Java or Clojure development skills. The jclouds API gives you the freedom to use portable abstractions or cloud-specific features. It's a multi-cloud toolkit that works with both public and private clouds, enabling hybrid cloud workloads. \nThere is a great community behind this toolkit working together to provide a better experience for developers in the cloud. Their goal is to simplify the control of many different clouds while still giving you the freedom to use cloud-specific features. The result is a toolkit that allows developers to write better code, in a shorter period of time, that works with supported clouds. \nIn this meeting, you will learn how to write Java that can control multiple clouds using interoperable code with jclouds. The agenda is as follows: \n1. Overview of jclouds, its terminology and its community. \n2. Purpose and benefits of using jclouds. \n3. Install jclouds for use on the command line. \n4. Work through an example of using jclouds to start virtual machines in the cloud. \n5. Work through an example of using jclouds to store files in the cloud.\nFor event agenda and online registration, please click here.\nIntroduction to Java 8\nDATE : October 24 , 2013 \nVENUE : Room M109, Core M, PolyU Campus \nREMARK(S) : We will discuss Java 8 and take a look at what's new and how to test it! \nFor event agenda and online registration, please click here.\n2013 ASTRI Industry and University Consultation Forum\nDATE : October 8 , 2013 \nORGANIZER(S) : The Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute \nREMARK(S) : The Industry and University Consultation Forum (IUCF) is a major event of ASTRI held annually in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

Extant market players are characterized by a long grown IT infrastructure and complex organizational structures. The emergence of digital opportunities such as (big) data analysis, artificial intelligence, or machine learning forces organizations to transform their strategies, capabilities, and structures to provide agile and innovative business reactions. These challenges associated with digital transformation will embrace a broader range of the workforce and intensify the interaction and cooperation of established organizational units.\nBased on three (internationally published) studies, Nico Wunderlich will discuss how digital transformation changes the co-working between the business and IT-side on different organizational levels. In this presentation, Nico Wunderlich will present who influences a fused IT and business strategy on managerial level, how IT decisions are allocated between IT and business units and how digital transformation moves the creation of organizational innovativeness within different hierarchical levels.\nNico Wunderlich\nGoethe University\nFrankfurt House of Finance\nwww.is-frankfurt.de/wunderlich\nNico Wunderlich is Doctoral Candidate in Information Systems and Research and Teaching Assistant at the Goethe University and the House of Finance in Frankfurt, Germany. At the Chair of Information Management of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang König, he intensifies his interest in how organizational culture and structures favor the change towards a fully digital enterprise.\nFrom 2015-2018, he acted additionally as Assistant to the Managing Director of the E-Finance Lab, a public-private cooperation of a network of industry partners and universities for research funding.\nSpecializing in Quantitative Methods and Business Psychology, he gained his M.Sc. in Business Administration from Goethe University Frankfurt in 2011. Before, during, and after his master studies he advised companies in IT-enabled business process optimization.",
