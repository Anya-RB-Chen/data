  "text": "A research paper titled “NeRFahedron: A Primitive for Animatable Neural Rendering with Interactive Speed” has been awarded the Best Paper Award at the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (i3D 2023). This paper was the outcome of the collaboration between Dr Hong Va LEONG, our associate professor and associate head, Dr Peter NG, our assistant professor, and Dr Zackary SIN, our research assistant professor. \nNeural rendering is a hot topic in computer graphics injecting machine learning techniques into classical rendering pipelines. It has been shown to be able to produce photo-realistic results that mirror scenes in reality. An issue, however, is that previous approaches have limitations in speed or animation. This paper proposes a novel neural rendering primitive, NeRFahedron, that can enable animatable content for neural rendering in real-time. It is believed that this work can lay the groundwork for deploying neural rendering to interactive applications like VR apps and games. It is expected to be beneficial for rendering photo-realistic environments for the metaverse in the future as well. Read the paper here.\nSIGGRAPH i3D is a leading conference that brings together researchers and practitioners working on real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction.

  "text": "We are delighted that Prof. Allen AU, our Professor; Dr Xingye LU, our Research Assistant Professor; Mengling LIU, our PhD student; and Chengru ZHANG, PhD student at HKU, have won the Plonk-DIZK GPU Acceleration Prize in the ZPrize Competition, receiving an award of $550,000 USD (approximately HKD 4,300,000). \nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which allow one to prove the validity of an assertion without revealing any other information, are considered a game-changing technology for Web3 as they can be used to protect data privacy and improve the efficiency, and scalability of transparent systems such as blockchain. It has the potential to be applied across a variety of industries, including financial services, healthcare, and supply chain management. However, a major challenge for the real-world adoption of ZKPs lies in their computational cost, particularly for applications at scale. To overcome this hurdle, the industry-wide ZPrize Competition was launched in 2022, aiming to enhance the performance of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for different applications or hardware platforms, which can significantly revolutionise user experience regarding privacy, security, and integrity, especially for blockchain applications. Teams competed for monetary prizes spanning a range of categories (7 open divisions and 5 team divisions). Over $7M in prize money has been committed.\nThe Plonk-DIZK GPU Acceleration category focused on accelerating a specific type of ZKPs called PLONK, which can be parallelised by distributing the proof generation procedure among multiple servers. Participants were required to apply the Distributed Zero-Knowledge Proof (DIZK) approach to accelerate the Plonk zero-knowledge proof protocol and improve the efficiency of Plonk-proof generation for gigantic circuits. However, due to the insufficient memory capacity of servers and some other real-world factors, it is considered to be extremely difficult to perform the acceleration. \nAs a result, only this team led by Prof. Au and Dr Xingye Lu successfully completed the tasks by demonstrating a 40% computation speedup compared to the baseline on a single machine. Compared with the original DIZK, which requires more than 2 hours with twenty powerful servers (each equipped with 244GB of RAM) to prove a circuit with 228 gates, the team only needs 48 minutes to generate such a proof. The team's approach involved moving the most time-consuming operations in the proof generation process to GPUs and using a categorisation of servers into dispatchers and workers to distribute the prover's computation across a cluster of computers with minimised communication costs. \nTheir solution is believed to be crucial for the broader adoption of ZKPs in various applications as it optimises scalability, efficiency, and resource consumption. The team will further generalise their distribution approach on PLONK and apply it to other ZKPs. \nOverall, the ZPrize Competition plays a significant role in advancing the field of zero-knowledge proof. We congratulate the team on their impressive achievement and look forward to seeing the impact of their winning submission on the broader adoption of zero-knowledge proof in the future.",

  "text": "The industrial collaborative paper entitled “Being Comes from Not-being: Open-vocabulary Text-to-Motion Generation with Wordless Training” is selected as a highlight at the IEEE / CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR) 2023. With more than nine thousand of submissions, only the top 2.5% of them are selected as highlights. This paper was the outcome of the collaboration between , Mr LIN Junfan, COMP Research Assistant and the first author of this paper; Prof. CHEN Changwen, our Chair Professor; and other five collaborators from PolyU, Sun Yat-sen University and Huawei Cloud respectively. The project is supported by the funding sponsored from Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd to PolyU.\nThis paper addresses the emerging and challenging problem of text-to-motion generation, which aims to synthesize motion with the same semantics as the input text. However, due to the lack of diverse labeled training data, most approaches either limit to specific types of text annotations or require online optimizations to cater to the texts during inference at the cost of efficiency and stability.\nIn this paper, an offline open-vocabulary text-to-motion generation in a zero-shot learning manner that neither requires paired training data nor extra online optimization to adapt for unseen texts is investigated. Inspired by the prompt learning in NLP, the paper pretrains a motion generator that learns to reconstruct the full motion from the masked motion. During inference, instead of changing the motion generator, the method proposed in this paper reformulates the input text into a masked motion as the prompt for the motion generator to ``reconstruct'' the motion. Read the paper here.\nCVPR is a premier annual computer vision event since 1985, which is regarded as one of the most important conferences in its field. The conference is highly selective in paper acceptance, and only the papers with the highest impact would be selected by the programme committee as the highlights or for oral presentations. This year, CVPR 2023 will be held from 18 to 22 June at the Vancouver Convention Center in Canada.",

  "text": "In the last decade, there has been a revolution in information and communications technology. The rise of mobile computing, blockchain, cloud service, machine learning, social media, and big data analytics alters the socio-economic activities and environment. These innovation technologies have touched every domain of our lives — empower us to create, to manage, and to personalise digital contents for better services.\nComputer science is one of the driving forces behind this huge technological revolution. It is a promising and fast developing discipline full of opportunities and challenges. How to build an entire ecosystem that combines both conventional and virtual spheres, generating value for the people while countering the possible risks? A knowledgeable workforce with wide-ranging technological expertise becomes indispensable, which leads computing education to be more critical than ever.\nWith over 48 years of efforts, today, the Department of Computing (COMP) at PolyU has turned into a strong and comprehensive academic department that nurtures trained talents and performs world-class research to support the society’s advancement as our primary goal.\nWe have gained international recognition in high quality education and research which is evidenced by our leading position in world university rankings over the past few years. For example, we secured the 34th position in Computer Science in the \"Best Global Universities Rankings\" by the U.S. News & World Report 2023, and we are also ranked 79th in Computer Science in the “Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2023”.\nBeing one of the largest computing departments in Hong Kong, we maintain a well-equipped and experienced team of more than 65 professional academic and teaching members. They have extensive international exposure and are devoted to cultivate the students to be future’s innovators. Our department offers various academic programmes to address the education needs of different stages, from undergraduate to postgraduate studies.\nAs new and emerging technologies are becoming visible and significant to our lives, we should go beyond basic training that integrates traditional theories and applications in computer science. We incorporated FinTech and AI in the curriculum and introduced a programme in these forefront areas. Apart from local education, COMP offers regular exchange programmes for students to develop their international outlooks, broaden their perspectives and ensure their worldwide exposure in this globalised era.\nTo enrich the best learning experience and prepare themselves for their future career, industrial internship opportunities in sizeable companies further allow students to gain real-world experiences that improve their employability after graduation. Our graduates attained an almost full employment rate and their average starting salary was the second highest among the Faculty of Engineering according to the PolyU Graduate Employment Survey 2021.\nAt international level, we possess a broad and close connection with the professional community and IT industry by inviting notable scholars and distinguished practitioners to serve as our Departmental Academic Advisors and Departmental Advisory Committee members, including Prof. Lui Sha from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Dr Xuedong Huang from Microsoft Corporation, and Dr Jingren Zhou from Alibaba Group.\nLooking into the future, we are very confident in further growing COMP into a leading department in AI+FinTech, Big Data, and IoT areas in Hong Kong. We welcome students and researchers with ambition and motivation to join our evolving journey!",

Through this programme, students are provided with practical knowledge/ skills and extra-curricular guidance to strengthen their employability. Some past activities of the TCP are shown below.\nCorda Training/ Certification Programme\nIn order to provide COMP students with more practical experience in blockchain application development, this programme was conducted in collaboration with the Hong Kong Blockchain Society. A series of workshops were organised for students. Students who pass a test would be awarded a certificate issued by the Hong Kong Blockchain Society.\nIn the workshops, core concepts of Corda, including state, contract, transaction, flow and node were introduced. To apply the concepts practically, students also solved programming problems, designed blockchain applications and developed CorDapps (applications on Corda) from scratch. This programme facilitated students to develop in the Fintech field. \nUnity Training/ Certification Programme\nThis was a six-month programme with the aim of assisting students to prepare for the Unity Certified Developer examination which is currently the only professional certification in the games industry. To get certified, candidates have to pass a rigorous test of technical and problem solving skills designed by specialists and experts from the games, 3D and interactive industries.\nObtaining this certification allows students to demonstrate their applied knowledge and technical programming skills that meet the industry standards, strengthens their competitiveness and enables them to develop in the game industry. \nJoint COMP/ ICMA Affiliate Membership Scheme\nThis “Joint COMP/ ICMA Affiliate Membership Scheme” offered students with free courses in strategic business analysis and strategic cost management, mentorship programme, internship referrals, networking opportunities, and free affiliate membership. This facilitated students to develop in the business/ finance field.\nICMA was officially incorporated in 1996 in Australia which aims to provide local prospective and practicing management accountants with the opportunity to attain the highly-regarded CMA professional qualification, whilst providing members with a wide range of professional development workshops and seminars on management accounting and current business topics. At present, there are 17 regional/ branch offices serving over 10,000 professional members over the world. \nInformation Security Training Programme\nTo further enhance students’ technical competencies and employability, a series of online workshops about the professional examinations of information security for Year 3 to 4 undergraduates and MSc students were organised. The workshops covered major technical topics, simulation and sample exercises, as well as included sharing by industry practitioners who are Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). Credentials like CISSP and CISA are two of the most popular ones that are highly regarded. \nThe workshop tutor and guest speakers reviewed the nature and scope of the examinations, qualifications and requirements for being fully certified upon gaining relevant work experience. Technical details, modules and sample questions under different scenarios were also discussed. These workshops enabled our students to obtain practical knowledge and helped them get prepared for the professional examinations.",

  "text": "1. Is credit transfer possible? What are the criteria for consideration?\nYou may apply for credit transfer for your previous study at postgraduate level. The subjects to be transferred should attain a normal performance grade (i.e. a minimum of grade B is expected).\nThe validity period of subject credits earned is eight years from the year of attainment, i.e. the year in which the subject is completed, unless otherwise specified by the department responsible for the content of the subjects (e.g. if the credit was earned in 2011/12, then the validity period should count from 2012 for eight years). Credits earned from previous studies should remain valid at the time when the student applies for transfer of credits.\nStudents can transfer a maximum of 50% of the total award requirement. Students admitted in or before 2018/19 academic year are allowed to transfer other Master level non-Computing subjects as electives up to 20% of the total award requirement (also counted towards the 50% upper limit for total credits to be transferred). This is subject to approval of the Programme Leader.\nIf the previous postgraduate subject was from PolyU and bear the same subject code, the credit transfer once approved will carry the grade. For previous study not with PolyU, the grade of transferred subject will not be counted towards GPA calculation. The final discretion will be with the programme leader.\n2. I understand there are two types of credit transfer. What are they and how do they work?\nThe first type is subject-to-subject matching, where we will compare the syllabus of our subject with that of the subject you studied. The second type is known as block credit transfer, which would allow you to transfer up to 6 credits.\n3. Is there a maximum number of credits to be transferred?\nYou can transfer up to 50% (i.e. 15 credits for MSc award) of the total programme requirements. It is inclusive of all kinds of transfer.\n4. How do I apply?\nSubmit online application (AR41c), together with respective transcript and syllabus, via eStudent system. Application should be normally submitted before the start of semester.\nStudents are advised to refer to the key dates and procedures posted on the intranet.\n1. If I want to take dissertation, when is the appropriate time?\nStudents should have completed not less than 15 credits of study in the registered programme with a GPA of 2.5 or above. Full-time students who have completed 9 credits of study with a GPA of 2.5 or above may consider taking dissertation from the second semester of their study.\n2. What is the duration of doing dissertation?\nThis will normally be completed within a 2-semester period.\n3. What is the procedure of taking dissertation?\nStudents who would like to take dissertation should first register for the subject during the subject registration exercise. They should then complete the “Form of Confirmation” with supervisor’s signature and return to the General Office before the end of add/drop period of each semester.\nUpon the deadline specified (usually around the 6th week of each semester), students are required to submit the initial project proposals taking reference from the \"Dissertation Proposal Submission Form\". By the end of that particular semester, students will submit the progress report on their project.\nStudents are advised to submit their first draft of dissertation to respective supervisors for comments before formal submission to the supervisor, co-examiner and panel chair on the specified deadlines (under cover of the \"Dissertation Submission Form\"). A presentation session will be arranged for each student.\n4. During the course of doing dissertation, what sort of forms I need to submit for the dissertation?\nStudents are required to download and submit the forms according to dissertation submission schedule:\n1. Form of Confirmation\n2. Dissertation Proposal Form\n3. Dissertation Progress Report\n4. Dissertation Submission Form\n5. Statement of Authorship\nAll the above forms can be obtained from the Intranet of Department of Computing (COMP). Since it is on the Intranet of COMP, students are required to enter their COMP’s login account and password in order to access the Intranet. If students have any questions about their COMP account, they can send an email to our technical team via helpdesk@comp.polyu.edu.hk or by phone at (852) 2766 7257. From the Intranet, students could view the information and procedures of Dissertation/ Project/ Independent Study in more details.\n5. What is the procedure/format of dissertation?\nAfter assessment, successful students will have to collect their dissertation copies from programme leader (or supervisor/ co-examiner). Any recommended changes should be incorporated into the dissertation and be approved by the supervisor before final submission (on a CD-ROM). References should be presented alphabetically, using the reference citation format for academic journal papers, conference papers, research reports and books in an internationally accepted format used by the discipline in which the study lies.\nThe MSc award is subject to the submission of TWO bound copies and ONE electronic copy of the final version of the dissertation. The binding should follow the format and specifications for dissertation (refer to the department website for details). The electronic copy should be either in Microsoft Word (XP or above) format or in Adobe Acrobat (5.0 or above) - PDF format with the \"Fast Wrap View\" feature, on a floppy diskette or CD-ROM. Failing the submission of the correct copies, your academic award WILL NOT be finalized and you will not be able to graduate on time.\n6. Should I find the dissertation supervisor myself or the department will allocate the supervisor to me?\nStudents should approach their potential supervisors for topics information and agreement to guide the students in preference for registering the dissertation regarding their area of interest. The dissertation topic can be freely discussed among students and academic staff. Students may select a research interest from the Research Interest List and approach the corresponding academic staff directly to formulate the topic. The Research Interest List has been posted on the Intranet of COMP for students’ reference, \n7. Should I need to do presentation after the submission of dissertation?\nYes. A presentation session will be arranged for each student. Normally, the presentation panel will consist of the supervisor, co-examiner and panel chair. The presentation will be normally held after the submission of final draft of the dissertation at a specific deadline. The venue of the presentation will be subject to the availability of the supervisor, the student and the co-examiner. Students are required to fix this up with their supervisor after the submission of final draft of dissertation.\n8. After I take the dissertation, what is the communication channel between my supervisor and me?\nIf students’ supervisors are PolyU staff, the main communication channel amongst them will be by email.\n9. What things should I do for the presentation?\nStudents should consult their supervisors regarding the real presentation formats. They are normally required to prepare PowerPoint slides related to their dissertation and present it in front of the presentation panel. After doing presentation, the supervisor/ co-examiner/ panel chair will ask questions related to the presentation content and students need to answer their questions in return. In general, the presentation will last for about 1 hour.",

  "text": "1. Is credit transfer possible? What are the criteria for consideration?\nYou may apply for credit transfer for your previous study at postgraduate level. The subjects to be transferred should attain a normal performance grade (i.e. a minimum of grade B is expected).\nThe validity period of subject credits earned is eight years from the year of attainment, i.e. the year in which the subject is completed, unless otherwise specified by the department responsible for the content of the subjects (e.g. if the credit was earned in 2011/12, then the validity period should count from 2012 for eight years). Credits earned from previous studies should remain valid at the time when the student applies for transfer of credits.\nStudents can transfer a maximum of 50% of the total award requirement. Students admitted in or before 2018/19 academic year are allowed to transfer other Master level non-Computing subjects as electives up to 20% of the total award requirement (also counted towards the 50% upper limit for total credits to be transferred). This is subject to approval of the Programme Leader.\nIf the previous postgraduate subject was from PolyU and bear the same subject code, the credit transfer once approved will carry the grade. For previous study not with PolyU, the grade of transferred subject will not be counted towards GPA calculation. The final discretion will be with the programme leader.\n2. I understand there are two types of credit transfer. What are they and how do they work?\nThe first type is subject-to-subject matching, where we will compare the syllabus of our subject with that of the subject you studied. The second type is known as block credit transfer, which would allow you to transfer up to 6 credits.\n3. Is there a maximum number of credits to be transferred?\nYou can transfer up to 50% (i.e. 15 credits for MSc award) of the total programme requirements. It is inclusive of all kinds of transfer.\n4. How do I apply?\nSubmit online application (AR41c), together with respective transcript and syllabus, via eStudent system. Application should be normally submitted before the start of semester.\nStudents are advised to refer to the key dates and procedures posted on the intranet.\n1. If I want to take dissertation, when is the appropriate time?\nStudents should have completed not less than 15 credits of study in the registered programme with a GPA of 2.5 or above. Full-time students who have completed 9 credits of study with a GPA of 2.5 or above may consider taking dissertation from the second semester of their study.\n2. What is the duration of doing dissertation?\nThis will normally be completed within a 2-semester period.\n3. What is the procedure of taking dissertation?\nStudents who would like to take dissertation should first register for the subject during the subject registration exercise. They should then complete the “Form of Confirmation” with supervisor’s signature and return to the General Office before the end of add/drop period of each semester.\nUpon the deadline specified (usually around the 6th week of each semester), students are required to submit the initial project proposals taking reference from the \"Dissertation Proposal Submission Form\". By the end of that particular semester, students will submit the progress report on their project.\nStudents are advised to submit their first draft of dissertation to respective supervisors for comments before formal submission to the supervisor, co-examiner and panel chair on the specified deadlines (under cover of the \"Dissertation Submission Form\"). A presentation session will be arranged for each student.\n4. During the course of doing dissertation, what sort of forms I need to submit for the dissertation?\nStudents are required to download and submit the forms according to dissertation submission schedule:\n1. Form of Confirmation\n2. Dissertation Proposal Form\n3. Dissertation Progress Report\n4. Dissertation Submission Form\n5. Statement of Authorship\nAll the above forms can be obtained from the Intranet of Department of Computing (COMP). Since it is on the Intranet of COMP, students are required to enter their COMP’s login account and password in order to access the Intranet. If students have any questions about their COMP account, they can send an email to our technical team via helpdesk@comp.polyu.edu.hk or by phone at (852) 2766 7257. From the Intranet, students could view the information and procedures of Dissertation/ Project/ Independent Study in more details.\n5. What is the procedure/format of dissertation?\nAfter assessment, successful students will have to collect their dissertation copies from programme leader (or supervisor/ co-examiner). Any recommended changes should be incorporated into the dissertation and be approved by the supervisor before final submission (on a CD-ROM). References should be presented alphabetically, using the reference citation format for academic journal papers, conference papers, research reports and books in an internationally accepted format used by the discipline in which the study lies.\nThe MSc award is subject to the submission of TWO bound copies and ONE electronic copy of the final version of the dissertation. The binding should follow the format and specifications for dissertation (refer to the department website for details). The electronic copy should be either in Microsoft Word (XP or above) format or in Adobe Acrobat (5.0 or above) - PDF format with the \"Fast Wrap View\" feature, on a floppy diskette or CD-ROM. Failing the submission of the correct copies, your academic award WILL NOT be finalized and you will not be able to graduate on time.\n6. Should I find the dissertation supervisor myself or the department will allocate the supervisor to me?\nStudents should approach their potential supervisors for topics information and agreement to guide the students in preference for registering the dissertation regarding their area of interest. The dissertation topic can be freely discussed among students and academic staff. Students may select a research interest from the Research Interest List and approach the corresponding academic staff directly to formulate the topic. The Research Interest List has been posted on the Intranet of COMP for students’ reference, \n7. Should I need to do presentation after the submission of dissertation?\nYes. A presentation session will be arranged for each student. Normally, the presentation panel will consist of the supervisor, co-examiner and panel chair. The presentation will be normally held after the submission of final draft of the dissertation at a specific deadline. The venue of the presentation will be subject to the availability of the supervisor, the student and the co-examiner. Students are required to fix this up with their supervisor after the submission of final draft of dissertation.\n8. After I take the dissertation, what is the communication channel between my supervisor and me?\nIf students’ supervisors are PolyU staff, the main communication channel amongst them will be by email.\n9. What things should I do for the presentation?\nStudents should consult their supervisors regarding the real presentation formats. They are normally required to prepare PowerPoint slides related to their dissertation and present it in front of the presentation panel. After doing presentation, the supervisor/ co-examiner/ panel chair will ask questions related to the presentation content and students need to answer their questions in return. In general, the presentation will last for about 1 hour.",

This year, with the sponsor from PolyU’s UG Summer Research Abroad Sponsorship Scheme, nine COMP students participated in the programme. The programme not only provided a valuable learning experience to our students but also granted them precious opportunity to look into the industry and be prepared for their further careers. \nStudents formed teams to research real-world challenges related to App Inventor, IoT, and Blockchain, with the guidance and supervision of their mentors from the industry during the six-week programme. By the end of the programme, teams got constructive feedback from mentors in return for the showcase of their findings. Students also had a chance to visit SICK Optic-Electronic Co. Ltd., a leading company in sensor intelligence and application solutions, gaining insight in a practical perspective.\nZHANG Wengyu and PAN Zewen (BSc (Hons) in Computing, Year 2 and 4 respectively) teamed up with one ISE Student to work on “lighTag: a UWB Positioning System Integrated in Lighting System and its Applications”. It is an application to locate people’s positions and control lights in an area. “Through this MIT Summer Programme, we were able to learn and explore fresh technologies and be supported and inspired by the most outstanding experts who are transferring knowledge into real life and industries.” Wengyu said. \nOn the other hand, PAN Yalu (BSc (Hons) in Financial Technology & Artificial Intelligence, Year 3) and her teammates: LI Muyuan (BSc (Hons) in Computing, Year 3), LIU Mingci and WANG Zhuchen (BSc (Hons) in Financial Technology & Artificial Intelligence, Year 3 and 4 respectively), focused on blockchain-related research. They used Solidity to design and write a smart contract that store and get notarized information from Ethereum. Yalu shared that she was able to develop critical thinking and coding skills in the process.",

Contestants were required to design creative solutions to crack different business cases in five tracks. Only the best teams from each track had the opportunity to pitch their projects to the panel of judges representing five influential corporates. The duo formed by COMP undergraduate students, AU Lok To Jack and YU Man Fai Daniel, won the 2nd runner-up in the “Chinachem Group” track with their project “Ninaland”. Both of them are year-three students studying BSc in Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence currently.\nNinaland is an innovative solution using the non-fungible token technology to promote sustainability and enrich communities, as well as to connect visitors to Nina Park - the first museum-grade fossil garden that will open this Autumn. Jack and Daniel shared that they have gained precious real-life experience from this competition and learnt a lot from the industrial mentors. Their biggest takeaways from the competition were the improved tech mindset and international friendship. Their journey climaxed in their visit to the ChinaChem office where they met their mentors in-person.\nHKGCC Business Case Competition was an open competition for tertiary students and recent graduates in Hong Kong. Students will learn from veteran business executives and be challenged by a panel of leading industry professionals, which is an experience rarely gained outside the classroom. ",

The paper presents a new response time bound for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) task using the total workload and the lengths of multiple long paths of the DAG, instead of the widely-applied longest path developed by Graham in 1969. This new bound theoretically dominates and empirically outperforms Graham's bound. It further extends the proposed approach to multi-DAG task systems. The schedulability test theoretically dominates federated scheduling and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.

The project aims to create an affective awareness agent, which can understand the user’s emotions from multiple input channels and make responses in support of VR.\nAnalysis of speech or facial expressions alone usually depicts human emotions inaccurately. The awarded project addresses these limits and examines the emotions of users with both speech and facial recognition. The speech of the user is captured in the microphone, while the facial expressions of the lower mouth are captured through the facial tracker attached to the headset. In return for the inputs, an agent replies by lip synchronising the response to the user according to the emotion analysed. The project was inspired by a few successful research projects published in academia and industry.\nDr LI Chen Richard, COMP Research Assistant Professor, is the supervisor of the project. “I am thankful to Dr Richard Li for his invaluable guidance and support throughout”, said Sweta.",

  "text": "Our Year 3 student, YU Man-Fai Daniel, won the Best UI/UX Award at Cathay Hackathon 2022 with a project called “Tripify”. As the team leader, Daniel joined hands with three teammates from The University of Hong Kong in creating an app extension for the “Cathay Learn” application. The concept of Tripify is building an ecosystem that not only motivates continuous learning activities by implementing a reward system, but also connects the airline to everyday life of the users. \nDaniel’s team stood out from a hundred teams and reached the final round. In 24 hours, finalists needed to develop a creative application that could address travel and environmental topics. The organiser, Cathay Pacific, prepared a behind-the-scenes tour for the finalists to deepen their understanding of aviation operations, helping finalists develop the application that fits best in real practice. “Before the competition, we know a little about how technology can be applied to real life. With the instructions and mentoring phase, we learnt to adapt innovative ideas and emerging technologies to building real-life solutions,” Daniel said.\nDespite the achievement in the end, the team had a bumpy start. Their first project idea was considered unworkable at the beginning of the final. Therefore, they decided to start all over again, but there was only half a day left for the development when their ultimate idea came out. Daniel shared that they cherished every second, clearly divided the tasks and work shifts, and most importantly, worked as a team. The result turns out to be encouraging, all the hard work worthwhile.\nCathay Hackathon 2022 was organised on 19 and 20 November 2022 at Cathay City. Local university students who want to disrupt the status quo and drive everlasting impacts gathered at the event and created pioneering technology solutions. A series of activities and mentoring sessions were arranged to boost young techs up.",

Other collaborators of this paper come from Pennsylvania State University, Zhejiang University, Tsinghua University, and Washington State University. \nThe paper proposes and develops a novel hardware-assisted analyzer for native code in apps. The research team leverages ETM, a hardware feature of ARM platform, and eBPF, a kernel component of Android system, to collect real execution traces and relevant memory data of target apps, and design new methods to scrutinise native code according to the collected data. To show the unique capability of NCScope, the team applies it to four applications that cannot be accomplished by existing tools, including systematic studies on self-protection and anti-analysis mechanisms implemented in native code of apps, analysis of memory corruption in native code, and identification of performance differences between functions in native code. The results uncover that only 26.8% of the analysed financial apps implement self-protection methods in native code, implying that the security of financial apps is far from expected. Meanwhile, 78.3% of the malicious apps under analysis have anti-analysis behaviours, suggesting that NCScope is very useful to malware analysis. Moreover, NCScope can effectively detect bugs in native code and identify performance differences.\nISSTA is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyse and test software systems.",

  "text": "We are proud to announce that the paper entitled “Curvable Image Markers: Towards a Trackable Marker for Every Surface” won the Best Paper Award at the 20th International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing & Multimedia Intelligence (MoMM2022). The first author of the paper is our PhD Candidate, Mr Zackary Ping Tat SIN, and his supervisors are Dr Hong Va LEONG (Associate Professor) and Dr Peter NG (Assistant Professor). This paper proposed adapting fiducial markers for curved surfaces, which aims at enhancing the interaction in Augmented reality (AR). \nAR possesses great potential for productivity, entertainment and communication, inclusive of the mobile context. Although the strength of AR is the blending of physical and virtual environments, current mobile applications seem to focus only on overlaying the virtual part upon the physical one. It is argued that an important direction to explore is how to enhance the interaction in AR such that physical elements can act upon the virtual ones. \nArUco is a popular choice in academia for tracking due to its relatively cheap processing cost and requiring only RGB input, making it also suitable for mobile devices. A fiducial marker like ArUco, however, is flat. To move towards enabling it for uneven surfaces, this paper proposed adapting the markers for curved surfaces to be suitable on bandages for warping around objects for tracking. The process involves curve modeling and content extraction. It also presents an image marker making use of neighborhood features to improve its appeal for AR purposes.\nMoMM is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all mobile computing and multimedia related areas.",

The work was also awarded Best Research Paper Award in VLDB (Very Large Data Bases Conference) in 2021. \nThis paper addresses the lack of scalability of existing attributed network embedding (ANE) techniques by proposing PANE, an effective and scalable approach for massive graphs in a single server that achieves state-of-the-art result quality on multiple benchmark datasets for two common prediction tasks: link prediction and node classification. Under the hood, PANE takes inspiration from well-established data management techniques to scale up ANE in a single server. Specifically, it exploits a carefully formulated problem based on a novel random walk model, a highly efficient solver, and non-trivial parallelization by utilizing modern multi-core CPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANE consistently outperforms all existing methods in terms of result quality, while being orders of magnitude faster. \nThe SIGMOD Research Highlight Award aims to make the selected works widely known in the database community, industry partners as well as the broader ACM community.

Ideally, the vector should capture the node's affinity to each attribute, which considers not only the node's own attributes but also those of its connected nodes in the graph. It is challenging to obtain high-utility embeddings; scaling effective ANE computation to massive graphs pushes the difficulty of the problem to a whole new level. \nIn this paper, Dr Shi and his team presented “PANE”, an effective and scalable ANE approach for massive graphs, which achieves state-of-the-art quality, measured by the accuracy of three prediction tasks. In particular, for a large graph with over 59 million nodes, 0.98 billion edges, and 2000 attributes, “PANE” is the only known viable solution that obtains effective embeddings on a single server, within 12 hours. “PANE” obtains superior performance through three main algorithmic designs. First, it formulates the learning objective based on a novel random walk model. Second, “PANE” includes an efficient solver for the objective, to drastically reduce the training cost. Finally, “PANE” utilizes multi-core CPUs through non-trivial parallelization, which achieves scalability while retaining the high quality of the results. \nVLDB is a premier annual international forum for data management and database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers, and users.

We believe the seminar can inspire students who wish to pursue development in this field.",

Six shortlisted students joined the final contest and competed for the awards. The panel of judges was formed by our faculty members and representatives from the technology sector, including Hong Kong Cyberport, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks, and InfoTech Services (HK) Limited. \nEach student was given fifteen minutes to present the project, finish a demonstration and undergo Q&A. All the projects fully demonstrated the depth of background study, breadth of the design and methodology, as well as excellent implementation and evaluation. Also, the high level of presentation skills shown by students was impressive. \nAfter careful and thorough consideration, our judges selected the winners and a virtual award presentation ceremony was held accordingly. In addition to the Best Project Awards, two contestants were selected to receive the InfoTech Job Market Driven Scholarship, based on the quality and relevancy of their projects in adopting hot skills highly sought by the IT industry.\nWe are proud to present the awardees here and let’s take this opportunity to congratulate them on receiving the awards. \nAward\nProject Title\nAwardee\nChampion\nInfoTech Job Market Driven Scholarship\nTouch-free User Interaction\nWang Ka Man\nFirst Runner-up Award\nEnhancement of Amblyopia Treatment and Monitoring in Children via an Ocular Gymnastics Application\nGerman Sharabok\nSecond Runner-up Award\nInfoTech Job Market Driven Scholarship\nGame Development\nLee Chi Kin",
