  "text": "The 8th PolyU Mechanical Engineering Research Presentation Competition was successfully held on 2 Mar 2023. It is an annual event for research students to display their research project results and share knowledge with the PolyU community.\nThe Research Student Liaison Officer, Dr David Navarro-Alarcon, introduced the competition emphasizing academic pitching skills, with an aim to train research students to explain academic ideas to peers and non-experts clearly. The Associate Head (Research), Dr Tang Hui, addressed the opening of this 8th annual competition which has been bringing invaluable opportunities for ME research students’ talents to be known.\nThis year, we invited 15 academics from 3 main discipline areas (Control, Acoustics and Dynamics; Materials and Solid Mechanics; Thermofluids and Combustion) to form a panel of judges to select the best presenters. Being one of the panel members, Prof. Cheng Li, Associate Dean (Research) of the Faculty of Engineering, was very glad to have witnessed the evolution of the event - from a simple and crude poster competition held outdoors at PolyU podium to a decent function supported by a very strong judging panel giving their professional review.\nTwenty research student participants each delivered a high-impact brief in a 3-minute presentation. With their professional and animated presentations, those academic and technical terms were no longer distant to the layman. Most of the participants demonstrated outstanding academic pitching skills. Prof. Wang Zuankai, Associate Vice President (Research and Innovation), as a judging panel member, was impressed by the performance of the candidates and the wide spectrum of research areas to which ME research students are dedicated. Prof. Wang Liqiu, another Chair Professor who recently joined the Department, was thrilled to listen to the pitching by young researchers and opined that with the key message, they grabbed the audience’s attention.\nAfter the oral presentations, participants interacted with the audience in the research posters exhibition. Displayed posters not only highlighted their research project results, but it was also an occasion for participants to convey their ideas, and communicate with viewers and professionals.\nAll other research students and PolyU staff members have also joined the event and vote for the People’s Choice award. They had appealed to a large audience to vote for them.\nProf. Su Zhongqing, Head of the Department, concluded the competition with a quote from Einstein “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”\nCongratulations on the fabulous presentations and excellent research work!\nChampion and People’s Choice\nStudent: Ms LABAZANOVA Luiza\nSupervisor: Dr David Navarro-Alarcon \nTitle: Self-Reconfigurable Soft-Rigid Multi-Agent System\n1st Runner-Up\nStudent: Ms HUO Xiaoyu \nSupervisor: Dr AN Liang \nTitle: Development of a redox flow battery for large-scale energy storage \n2nd Runner-Up\nStudent: Mr LIANG Zhaojian \nSupervisor: Dr LI Mengying \nTitle: Energy storage using solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) - A story about speeds \nMerit\nStudent: Ms ZHANG Kouer \nSupervisor: Dr AN Liang \nTitle: Green ammonia production from electrocatalytic nitrate reduction under ambient conditions",

  "text": "2017, BEng(Hons) in Mechanical Engineering\nGraduate Trainee, ATAL Engineering Limited\nHave you ever thought about how faucets bring you water or how air conditioners generate cool or warm air?\nWithout adequate knowledge, how can we be capable of designing and building different facilities and equipment?\nWelcome to the PolyU Department of Mechanical Engineering. During the course of my studies in the past few years, I have the same goal as other schoolmates – striving for a higher GPA. Yes! This is one effective way to show how well you have learnt and how exceptionally prepared you are for your future. To me, I have interpreted GPA as “Gathered, Patient and Aggressive”.\nGathered\nSome people prefer working alone because they may reckon that others would obstruct their learning progress. However, I believe your schoolmates can be your support and motivation to keep you moving forward. Through discussions and cooperation, you will discover the fun of studying with your peers and develop deeper understanding of the programme. .\nPatient\nAs a university student, you delve into different concepts and explore as much as you can. Do not feel disappointed when you encounter problems. Instead, I encourage you to put more effort patiently on the things you have never come across. Believe it or not, eventually you will not only solve the problems, you will be able to grasp the main concepts and also grow your knowledge thoroughly.\nAggressive\nInstructors and teachers are your learning partners. Be an aggressive student! Ask your instructors whenever you have questions in your mind. I am sure that they are always happy to guide you to the right direction.\nYou will be proud of yourself once you equip yourself with professional skills and knowledge in your university studies\nI am now a Graduate Trainee at ATAL Engineering Limited. I never stop learning every day in my work.\nHope all of you have a treasurable and fruitful university life at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of PolyU.",

However, ultrahigh-strength materials typically suffer from low tensile ductility, which severely limits their practical utility.\nRecently, a research team led by Dr JIAO Zengbao, assistant professor of PolyU Department of Mechanical Engineering, developed an innovative design concept for high-performance materials by engineering nanolamellar architectures, which leads to the development of new bulk nanostructured materials with an unprecedented combination of over 2 GPa yield strength and 16% uniform tensile ductility at ambient temperature. The extraordinary mechanical properties of the newly developed alloys offer tremendous potential for structural applications in aerospace, automotive, and energy industries. In addition, the fundamental concept of lamellar architecture engineering can be applied to many other metallic materials, including new-generation superalloys, titanium alloys, and advanced steels, to achieve enhanced properties for specific applications.\nThis work has been recently published in Nature Communications [“Ultrahigh strength and ductility in newly developed materials with coherent nanolamellar architectures”, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20109-z].

Although the linear field of shear waves has been studied for damage detection for a few decades, it appears that nonlinear shear wave propagation has not been fully explored for material evaluation. There is enough theoretical evidence demonstrating good sensitivity of nonlinear shear wavefield to material defects. Various classical and non-classical nonlinear phenomena in shear wave propagation will be demonstrated. The major focus will be on analytical and numerical analysis. In addition, challenges and opportunities in this field will also be presented.",

He received his bachelor’s degree in Polymer Materials and Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2012. In 2016, he earned his Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where he studied the properties of van der Waals materials. In 2018, he began his postdoc journey at the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked on developing rapid and scalable handheld devices of carbon nanotube gas sensors for disease screening, engineering van der Waals materials for exploration of their topological physics, and, more recently, integrated topological phononic circuitry.\nAbstract\nTopological phenomena, like the protected edge mode in which waves can travel around large imperfections without back-reflection, envision enticing applications. Although initially emerging from the study of the quantum Hall effect, topological phases are universal in various fields, including photonics, mechanics, and phononics. In this talk, I will discuss my topological phase engineering work. I will show some results in CVD few-layer graphene, particularly in engineering AB/BA domain walls where quantum valley Hall edge modes are afforded. Then I will present some results of topological phononics in piezoactive materials, which are essential for applications in communications, quantum information science, sensing, etc. First, I will demonstrate valley Hall phases in piezoelectric AlN at GHz. Second, a theoretical framework for studying topological phases in piezoelectric and piezomagnetic materials will be discussed. Here I will reveal that an unexpected factor, the general duality relation, plays a crucial role in engineering symmetry breaking and topological phases.",

After a brief staying as a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and the Argonne National Laboratory, he joined the investment bank Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York. He came back to academia in 1998. From 1998 to 2001, he was an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University. Currently, he is a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nProfessor Li's research focuses on understanding fundamental properties and processes of materials, and predicting material behaviours. The approaches used in his research are a blend of those from statistical physics, solid state physics, materials science, metallurgy, mechanics and large-scale, high-performance computing. His research focuses on algorithm development, simulation, and theoretical analysis.\nAbstract\nStructure-property relation is a foundation of materials science and engineering. Atomic structure is at the center of this endeavor that guides and helps material design, processing, application, and basic scientific understanding of material properties. We are truly fortunate to be able to “see” atomic structures in crystalline materials where Bragg diffraction is made possible by the periodic atomic packing. In amorphous solids, the structural disorder is down to the atomic scale that has prevented us from observing atomic structure. As a result, the important structure-property relation has remained a mystery up to date.\nIn this talk, I will review two widely accepted hypotheses of atomic packing in metallic glasses, one is the atomic cluster packing and the other the fractal packing. These two proposed atomic structures cover the short- and medium-range ordering with universality across many materials systems. Here I will show that neither the cluster nor the fractal packing is convincingly rooted in physics. For example, the icosahedral cluster is found not to be the local atomic packing with the lowest energy as previously thought, and the fractal packing does not exist at all. \nThese contradictory findings, however, do not solve the issues of the atomic structure, instead pose more questions to us. In this talk, I will explain the reasons and arguments behind our findings and pose new questions that may inspire students and researchers to join the work for discovery of the atomic structure of amorphous solids and liquids.",

He has been named by Clarivate Analytics as being among the top 1% of researchers cited in his field every year since 2014.\nAmmonia is a promising carbon-free alternative fuel for use in combustion systems. The main associated challenges are its relatively low reactivity and high NOx emissions compared to conventional fuels. Since a number of fundamental combustion experiments have been carried out over a wide range of combustor relevant conditions, there is a need to develop a detailed chemical kinetic model that can capture the combustion properties of ammonia and it blended mixtures with hydrogen, hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbon fuels over a wide range of conditions. The underlying chemistry controlling fuel reactivity and the formation of NOx species, either for pure ammonia or for its mixtures with other fuels will be discussed. Moreover, the effect of NOx species on hydrocarbon combustion will be discussed as will the important reactions controlling their interactions.",

Prior to Brinc, I worked on several projects including the development of a biped robot and an automated rover; I led a team that participated in a NASA-sponsored competition where the teams had to design and build a miniature space drone system, I also worked at Procter & Gamble as project manager and team leader for the development of a new product and the upgrade of its production line. I was awarded the prestigious Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme and joined the PolyU High-speed Thermo-ﬂuid and Manned/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Laboratory where I developed a software, which I hope, will help to design the next generation of space vehicles, drones, and planes.\nDr AHMAD Shakeel\nPostdoctoral Fellow, City University of Hong Kong\nWhen I started my PhD study in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2015, I set my goal to develop a career that combined research and teaching. I was particularly fascinated by the multiphase flow and phase-change phenomena in fluids, and I was excited when PolyU offered me the opportunity to work in this area. Under the inspiring guidance of my PhD supervisor, Dr TANG Hui, I polished my skills and obtained promising results in good time. My research results were acclaimed and published in internationally recognized top journals. Soon after completing the PhD, I was able to secure a postdoctoral position on an industrial project and won another research grant in the postdoc. In addition to research activities, I was also assigned teaching assistant duties in PolyU. Through mentoring undergraduate students, I got valuable teaching experience which has brought me one step closer to my long-term post-PhD teaching goal. All in all, I feel joyous and thankful to PolyU for giving me a solid start for a career that I want.\nDr LI Wenting\nResearch Scientist, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology\nThe research skills and robust knowledge that I have learnt from PolyU trains me up to solve practical problems in the industry from a sound scientific perspective. In addition, receiving mentorship from my PhD supervisor Prof. FU Ming Wang geared me up in terms of smart-working and devotion with great confidence, and these are core elements of my career development. After graduation, my career goal is to solve technical problems in the industry through the knowledge and methods that I have learned from college, and without the platform SIMTech provided where the objective would not be achieved. I can foresee that more and more precisive and advanced industrial prototypes created by us will be utilized in various industries in the near future.\nDr YANG Haopeng\nPostdoctoral Researcher, Hong Kong Productivity Council\nI conducted my research in advanced manufacturing technology including superplastic deformation, semisolid forming and microforming, which equipped me with the adequate knowledge and know-how for my postdoctoral research. Having the research practical experience in the smart manufacturing field, I hope to further pursue in the area of Industry 4.0 in the future.

Operated by a peristaltic pump, the solution is fed from the reservoir to a feed trough from which a conveyor conveys feed solution in the trough in a very thin layer. Under high voltage electric field, the thin feed layer is drawn into fine threads and subsequently to small-diameter nanofibers of less than one micron deposited on the collecting travelling substrate. The thickness of the nanofiber mat can be controlled by the speed of the travelling substrate. The nanofiber diameter, depending on the material, can be controlled by the voltage and feed-collector separation distance. The relative humidity of the room is controlled well below 55% for electrospinning.\nThe curing of the wet as-spun nanofiber can be speed-up by the vacuum oven. The lab is also equipped with a sink for washing and cleaning of flasks. \nElectrospinning machine is controlled by advanced electronic control.\nThe two feed electrodes provide a uniform nanofiber mat coated on the travelling substrate.",

H L, MW Fu, Deformation Based Processing of Materials: Behavior, Performance, Modelling, and Control, Elsevier, Nov, 2018\nDeformation based processing is one of important enabling manufacturing processes in nowadays’ manufacturing and product development industries for its high productivity, low production cost and unique advantages in shapes and geometries generating and performance tailoring. The parts or components produced by this manufacturing process such as sheet metal and bulk forming are widely used in many industry clusters, ranging from computer, home appliance, medical, consumer electronics, automobile to aerospace industries. It is well recognized that nearly 70% of metallic products are handled by the deformation based processing. The high demand for shorter design and development lead time, lower production cost, better dimensional accuracy and overall forming quality has become the bottleneck issues in current deformation based manufacturing for maintaining and improving the market competitiveness and technological cutting-edge for the companies using this technology for their production.However, non-uniform stress and strain distributions are frequently induced during the deformation based processing of materials. In case the inappropriate thermal-mechanical loading conditions applied, the undesirable deformation such as unstable deformation may occur and induce the higher potential occurrence of various defects along with deformation such as damage/ductile fracture, compressive instabilities and surface roughening, etc. The occurrence of these different types of defects directly affects the behaviour and performance of deformation process and the quality of the deformed parts, which thus greatly limits the development and wide application of deformation based materials processing and manufacturing. In tandem with this, it is the everlasting fundamental issues and challenging problems as well as frontier topics to explore the deformation behaviours and process performance in ways a way to well control deformation, product quality, defect avoidance in this crucial manufacturing area.Currently, there are plenty of publications, including edited books, journal papers, proceedings etc., available on various aspects of deformation based processing from fundamental theory to technology innovation. However, there is still lack of a monograph that systematically and thoroughly addresses the process behaviour, performance, modelling and control with the latest research findings and achievements. The book will summarise state of the art research on deformation based processing of materials and provide a systematic and informative knowledge in this domain specific area for researchers, engineers, students and management professionals in manufacturing arena. \n2. XM Lai, MW Fu, LF Peng, Sheet Metal Meso- and Microforming and Their Industrial Applications, Taylor & Francis Group, June, 2018\n‘Sheet Metal Meso- and Microforming and Their Industrial Applications’ presents state-of-the-art researches on meso- and microforming processes and the needed information and the systematic and holistic knowledge for physical realization of the developed meso- and microforming processes and the tangible and practical applications in fabrication of meso- and micro-scaled metallic sheet-metal parts via sheet-metals meso- and microforming. The applications include fabrication of thin metallic bipolar plates for fuel cells. In tandem with this, the book provides extensive and informative illustrations, tables, case study photos and figures to convey the information and knowledge of sheet-metal meso- and microforming and meso- and micro-scaled sheet-metal products clearly and directly to readers.Sheet metals meso- and microforming refers to the fabrication of meso/micro-scaled sheet metal parts via meso- and microforming of sheet-metals or using sheet-metals as raw material to directly make meso/micro-scaled bulk metal parts. It is well known that the systematic knowledge of the traditional sheet metal forming, the so-called sheet metal macroforming in this book, is well established and widely used many industrial clusters, the same, however, cannot be said to the meso- and microforming as there are still many eluded and tantalized issues in this down-sized scale forming process which need to be further explored and investigated. Recently, plenty of good efforts have been provided to the extensive research in this domain. This book is thus to summarize the latest research outcomes in this area in terms of addressing some critical issues including meso- and microforming process determination, tooling design, product quality assurance and control, and the size-effect affected behaviors and phenomena and applications. This book is intended for research students, manufacturing and product development engineers and professionals working in the areas of manufacturing and materials processing.\n3. MW FU, Design and Development of Metal Forming Processes and Products aided by Finite Element Simulation, Springer International Publishing AG, 2016\nThis book presents state-of-the-art research on forming processes and formed metal product development aided by the Finite Element method (FEM). Using extensive and informative illustrations, tables and photographs, it systematically presents real-life case studies and established findings regarding various forming processes and methods aided by FE simulation, and addresses various issues related to metal formed part design, process determination, die design and die service life analysis and prolongation, as well as product quality assurance and improvement.Metal forming has been widely used in many industries. This traditional manufacturing process, however, has long been linked to many years of apprenticeship and skilled craftsmanship, and its conventional design and development paradigm appeared to involve more heuristic know-how and trial-and-error than in-depth scientific calculation, analysis and simulation. The design paradigm for forming processes and metal formed product development thus cannot meet the current demands for short development lead-times, low production costs and high product quality. With the advent of numerical simulation technologies, the design and development of forming processes and metal formed products are carried out with the aid of FE simulation, allowing all the potential design spaces to be identified and evaluated, and the best design to ultimately be determined and implemented. Such a design and development paradigm aims at ensuring “designing right the first time” and reducing the need for trial-and-error in the workshop. This book provides postgraduates, manufacturing engineers and professionals in this field with an in-depth understanding of the design process and sufficient knowledge to support metal formed part design, forming process determination, tooling design, and product quality assurance and control via FE simulation.\n4. MW Fu, WL Chan, Micro-scaled product development via microforming: Deformation behaviors, Processes, Tooling and its realization, Springer-Verlag London Ltd. 2014\n‘Micro-scaled Products Development via Microforming’ presents state-of-the-art research on microforming processes, and focuses on the development of micro-scaled metallic parts by microforming processes. Microforming refers to the fabrication of microparts via micro-scaled plastic deformation and presents a promising micromanufacturing process. When compared to other micromanufacturing processes, microforming offers advantages such as high productivity and good mechanical properties of the deformed microparts. This book provides extensive and informative illustrations, tables and photos in order to convey this information clearly and directly to readers.Although the knowledge of macroforming processes is abundant and widely used in industry, microparts cannot be developed by leveraging the existing knowledge of macroforming because the size effect presents a barrier to this knowledge transfer. A systematic knowledge of microforming thus needs to be developed. In tandem with product miniaturization, the demand on microparts has been increased for their wide applications in many industries, including automotive, bio-medical, aerospace and consumer electronics industries. Micromanufacturing technologies have already become an important and promising manufacturing process. This book is intended for postgraduates, manufacturing engineers and professionals working in the areas of manufacturing and materials processing.\n5. JY Fuh, YF Zhang, AYC Nee and MW Fu, Computer-aided injection mould design and manufacture, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, April 2004. (ISBN:0-8247-5314-3, E-ISBN:0-8247-5119-3, pages 372)\nTool engineering constitutes an important branch of manufacturing engineering as any direct improvement of existing tooling processes or an introduction of novel processes could significantly improve the production efficiency, product quality and reduce design and processing time. This would enhance the competitiveness of a manufacturing company and maintain its leading edge over its competitors. Tooling design is as important a topic as the manufacturing process itself. Without suitable tooling, manufacturing processes are often crippled or rendered totally inefficient. With the increasing use of computer tools and technology, this scenario has changed rapidly since the introduction of CAD/CAM/CAE tools in the early 1980s. It is the authors’ beliefs that CAD/CAM technologies are playing more and more important roles in the tooling industry to shorten the design and manufacturing lead-times.Mould making is an important sector in precision engineering industry since the moulded parts and components represent more than 70% of the consumer products ranging from computers, home appliances, medical devices, to automobiles, etc. While CAD/CAM technologies have found a wide range of applications in the many areas of engineering, its applications to mould design and manufacturing have been relatively limited.

  "text": "PhD; Senior MAIAA; MASME; MIED; MIOA; MHKIE; MHKIOA\nDr Leung’s research interest is in flow-induced sound and structural vibration, computational aeroacoustics, aviation science, diagnostics and control for product noise and vibration, product sound quality design. He received his BEng in Mechanical Engineering in 1992 and PhD in Fluid Dynamics and Acoustics in 1997, both from The University of Hong Kong. He then continued his postdoctoral research in acoustic resonance of marine gas turbine exhaust system at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, U.K. in 1998 and flow-induced vibration of turbine blade at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 1999. Afterwards, he moved to industry and took up a sound engineer position at Emerson Climate Technologies, supporting the sound and vibration design for reciprocating/scroll refrigeration compressors and systems. Dr Leung joined The Hong Kong Polytechnic University again in 2002 and is serving as an Assistant Professor. Apart from extensive teaching and research activities, he also actively provides consultancy practices to industry.\nProject 1: Smart Modulation of Flow Separation On Streamlined Composite Structure Using Embedded Shape Memory Alloy Actuators\nFunding Body:\nCompetitive Earmarked Research Grant, Research Grants Council of HKSAR Government\nPrincipal Investigator:\nDr Randolph C. K. Leung\nCo-Investigators:\nDr Alan K. T. Lau, Prof. Ronald M. C. So and Dr L. M. Zhou\nResearch Personnel:\nMiss Elizabeth W. S. Kam (Research Student)\nMiss Angela O. K. Leung (Research Assistant)\nAbstract of the Project:\nFlow past streamlined structures separates under certain conditions. The separated boundary layer, depending on the flow Reynolds number and pressure gradient dictated by structure surface geometry, will either reattach to the structure surface or rolls up to form vortices that are shed into the structure wake. Such series of vortex dynamical processes are detrimental to the primary aerodynamic characteristics, such as lift and drag, of the structure as well as such secondary consequence as aerodynamic noise generation. In fixed- and rotary- aircrafts, not only will this phenomenon cause severe wing/rotor blade vibration; it will also generate noise. The rapidly changing induced velocity field due to the separating unsteady vortical flow could cause large and time varying fluctuations in wing/blade loading. Although there are control techniques based on momentum-injection and use of flaps/spoilers to alter the separation on the wing/blade surface, their applications may be difficult to integrate with existing wing/blade design since additional structures will be installed and/or redesign of the entire wing/blade structure may be needed. An alternative approach to control flow separation is to employ smart materials and structures technology to give desirable shape and strength profiles for the streamlined structures. Shape memory alloys (SMA) actuator is one of the major elements of smart materials and structures. The SMA actuators can be embedded into a structure made of composite material and be controlled individually over a structure span. The controls can modify aerodynamic loading distribution along the structure span in addition to its natural frequency. In this project, the control of flow separation using an advanced composite streamlined structure with integrated SMA actuators is studied. The optimization of the control of structure surface deformations and strength variations through the use of a different number of actuators, different interval spacings of the actuators and different locations of embedment is also attempted.\nProject 2: Nonlinear Fluid-Structure Interaction of an Elastic Lifting Surface Undergoing Dynamic Stall and Its Control\nFunding Body:\nCompetitive Earmarked Research Grant, Research Grants Council of HKSAR Government\nPrincipal Investigator:\nDr Randolph C. K. Leung\nCo-Investigators:\nProf. Ronald M. C. So and Prof. L. Cheng\nResearch Personnel: \nDr W. Q. Qian (Research Associate)\nAbstract of the Project:\nDynamic stall of lifting surface has been known to be a factor that limits the performance and operation envelope of rotors designed for helicopters, wind turbines, and axial-flow compressors. Multiple factors conspire to render dynamic stall a physically complex and challenging phenomenon to comprehend. Viewed as an essentially two-dimensional flow process, dynamic stall commences when the angle of attack of the lifting surface dynamically exceeds the static stall limit. When this happens, the unsteady boundary layer separates near the leading edge from the suction surface, rolls-up to form a tiny, but energetic dynamic stall vortex. This vortex rapidly intensifies, convects quickly downstream, and sheds from the lifting surface. During this process, the low pressure region generated by the vortex results in significant lift amplification beyond static levels, which is followed by the occurrence of abrupt deep stall at vortex shedding. The lift amplification characteristics is certainly beneficial as far as the rotor operation is concerned; however, the highly fluctuating aerodynamic loads, the strong stresses and subsequently high fatigue imposed on the lifting structure hinder the full utilization of the lift enhancement. Despite tremendous efforts in understanding the dynamic stall physics and suppressing its adversity, past studies appear to have ignored a very important physical parameter arising from practical reality; that is the aero-elastic behavior of the lifting surface due to its long span. The aeroelasticity of the lifting surface provides a feedback to the flow excitation forces via its motion responses and the highly non-linear interaction between the flowing fluid and the moving structure. The coupled fluid-structure interaction would alter the development of dynamic stall since the structural responses of the lifting surface are now important. If these coupled responses are ignored, existing knowledge of the physics of dynamic stall and the proposed control methods will most likely become deficient. The aim of the proposed research is to attempt to bridge this knowledge gap and to suggest a dynamic stall control scheme that is more applicable to practical situations.\nProject 3: Aeroacoustic Resonance of In-Duct Cascade\nFunding Body:\nInternal Competitive Research Grant, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nPrincipal Investigator:\nDr Randolph C. K. Leung\nCo-Investigators: \nDr S. K. Tang (BSE, HKPolyU)\nAbstract of the Project:\nNoise from the air-conditioning and ventilation system has long been a problem in the building industry and its control is always a challenge to the acoustical and building services engineers. The problem becomes acute in a modernized city like Hong Kong where many high-rise and heavily serviced buildings are required. Owing to the adverse effects of over-exposure to noise, a good acoustical indoor environment is important for human health. Seldom the air inside the air-conditioning and ventilation ductworks can flow through without encountering any obstructions or restrictions. In reality because of design requirements and space limitations, the flow needs to change direction, thus leading to branching and the necessity to introduce internal guide vanes to smooth transition, bends, and different types of junctions. In addition, high-static-pressure air flows need to be vented or throttled. As a result, devices/elements are introduced into the flow and they will invariably affect the flow structure and behavior inside the air-conditioning and ventilation ductworks. Turbulence is also generated at these duct devices. One of the most popular system devices is the in-duct silencer with an absorbing splitter plates amid the duct flow. Splitter silencers are commonly used in ducts for absorbing the noise produced by flow handling equipment, such as ventilation system fans and ground based gas turbine installations. Such splitter plates not only absorb the noise incident on their absorptive surfaces, but also regenerate noise resulting from the unsteady flow and turbulence in the splitter wakes. The major objectives of the proposed research are:\n(i) to identify and understand an important aeroacoustical physics, namely acoustic resonance, of cascade structures residing in air-conditioning and ventilation duct flow. The resonance is related to the sound generation and amplification within the duct. This part is to identify the important governing parameters for acoustic resonance in an in-duct cascade setting.\n(ii) to verify the findings in (i) using an experimental ventilation duct.\n(iii) to derive, based on the results of (i) and (ii), the optimal design guidelines for cascade parameters that suppress in-duct cascade resonance in practical air-conditioning and ventilation ductworks.\n10 Most Representative Research Outputs\nX.

He was elected as a Fellow of Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and Fellow of American Institute of Chemical Engineers.\nBrief Description of Three Research Projects:\nProject 1:\nThe New Generation of High Capacity Batteries for Energy Storage (Supported by PolyU Centre of Excellence)\nProject Objective: The ultimate objective of the proposed research would be the synthesis and improvement of the materials for high capacity batteries systems with safe operation, long service life and low cost. Specifically, the efforts will be focused on the cathode, anode, electrolyte and separator development for high voltage lithium (sodium) ion batteries, and lithium (sodium)-sulfur batteries for power supply and energy storage. For high voltage lithium (sodium) ion batteries development, it will involve\ncathode materials synthesis from MO2+LiF or MO2 + NaF using solid state reaction in a high speed ball mill;\nmaterials surface modification by coating of conductive polymers using oxidative chemical vapor deposition method (oCVD);\nselection of proper additives and binders for high capacity anode materials such as silicon and metal oxides;\nexploration of high conductivity ionic liquid or gel as high voltage electrolyte;\nassembly of pouch cells to build an energy storage or power supply device with proper battery management system.\nFor lithium (sodium)-sulfur batteries investigation, it will involve\nimmobilization of S and polysulfides in the cathode compartment using novel porous carbon or metal oxides so that the stability of the battery can be maintained;\ninvestigation of tough materials such as ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) as the separator so as to prevent the short-circuit from the lithium (sodium) dendrites formed on the anode;\nsynthesis of polymeric solid electrolyte with sufficient ion and electron conductivity so as to enhance the safety of the Li(Na)-S batteries;\nexploration of the surface modification and additives to the electrolyte to suppress the formation of lithium (sodium) dendrites;\nassembly of pouch cells to build an energy storage or power supply device with proper battery management system.\nTheoretical study of the materials based first principles analysis and density function theory calculation will also be employed for the materials screening and redox mechanism understanding.\nProject 2:\nOxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition of Conductive Polymers on Particle Materials as Cathodes for Lithium Ion Batteries (Supported by RGC-GRF)\nEnergy is one of the most challenging problems for mankind today. Renewable energy is the future, and energy storage is very important for effective renewable energy utilization because of the mismatch between supply and demand. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) offer a highly promising energy storage system for power grid load leveling and the transportation of power supplies. The properties of the electrode particles significantly affect the performance of LIBs. To enhance the electrical or ionic conductivity, service life, and/or rate performance of the electrodes, a conductive polymer coating has proven effective. Although thickness control and conformality are very important factors for the effective coating of such polymers, conventional coating is conducted either in a liquid or solid phase, leading to non-uniform coating or aggregate formation on the electrode particles.\nOxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) of polymeric materials has been shown to be a “green” process as it can produce a conformal polymer layer on small particles without the involvement of solvents. The desired morphology and thickness can be achieved by changing operating conditions such as the temperature, pressure, type of initiator, rate of particle agitation, and coating time.\nIn this proposed work, the oCVD method will be employed to coat three common types of conductive polymers on solid particles typically utilized in LIB production. Specifically, PEDOT, PPy, and PAni will be coated onto lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide, a cathode material used in high-capacity LIBs. Operating conditions such as the substrate temperature, vacuum of the reactor, initiator, and monomer will be investigated to identify coating conditions for the optimal electrochemical performance of the batteries, mainly in terms of rate performance, coulombic efficiency, and service life.\nThe reasons behind the enhanced performance of the coated materials will be found by comparing the effects of coating type and composition. The success of the project will have an important effect on the production of durable LIBs for power supply and energy storage applications.\nProject 3:\nPreparation, Properties and Mechanism Study of High Performance Cathodes for Li-S Batteries: Electron and Lithium Ion Transmission Enhancements and Anchoring of Polysulfides (Supported by NSFC/RGC)\nProject Objectives: In this project, constructions and fabrications of lithium ion conductor-modified S/hetero-atom(s) doped carbons (S/HCs@LIC) cathode materials and electrodes with lithium ion and electron transmission enhancement and anchoring of polysulfides are proposed to improve the rate performance and cycling stability of Li-S batteries. Specifically, the project objectives are:\nTo prepare hetero-atom(s) doped carbons (HCs) with micro- and meso-pores to enhance the conductivity and lithium ion (Li+) transmission and to anchor sulfur/polysulfides for S/HCs cathode materials during the discharge/charge cycles.\nTo modify S/HCs cathode materials by lithium ion conductor (LIC) coating for further enhancement of Li+ transmission, adsorption and anchoring of sulfur/polysulfides of the cathode materials.\nTo investigate the diffusion of intermediate products, interface structure and phase transformation of S/HCs@LIC during cycling by simulation, in-situ/ex-situ physiochemical and electrochemical characterizations, and elucidate the mechanism of polysulfide anchoring.\nTo fabricate the large-capacity prototype Li-S batteries using S/HCs@LIC cathode materials and to investigate the impacts of the particle size of S/HCs@LIC’s, electrode compositions (S/HCs@LIC, conductor, binder and additives) and fabrication process on the porous structure and interface properties of the as-prepared electrodes, the electron and Li+ transfer, and electrochemical performance of the batteries.\nTo fabricate S/HCs@LIC cathode materials with a specific capacity of ≥ 1000 mAh g-1 based on S mass (700 mAh g-1 based on S/HCs@LIC mass) and a capacity retention ratio of over 80% after 1000 cycles at 1 C rate (1600 mA g-1), and to provide electrodes based on S/HCs@LIC active material for practical applications of Li-S batteries.\nSelected Journal Publications\na) Selected Refereed Journal Publications – Ten representative ones in recent five years\nSu, J., Bai, Z., Huang, B., Quan, X. and Chen, G., Unique three dimensional architecture using a metal-free semiconductor cross-linked bismuth vanadate for efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation, Nano Energy, 24(2016)148-157.\nDeng, Y., Xu, H., Bai, Z., Huang, B., Su, J. and Chen, G., Durable polydopamine-coated porous sulfur core–shell cathode for high performance lithium–sulfur batteries, Journal of Power Sources, 300 (2015) 386-394.\nZhang, L.T., Tarascon, J-M, Sougrati, M.T., Rousse, G. and Chen, G., Influence of relative humidity on structure and electrochemical performance of sustainable LiFeSO4F electrode for Li-ion batteries, J Mater.

Walpole, MA, USA (largest industrial centrifuge manufacturer in the world) as Senior Research Scientist and later as Director of Process Technology responsible for R&D of all solid-liquid separation equipment (nearly 100 different types) and related applications. For 15 years, he worked closely with Prof. Ascher H. Shapiro, Institute Professor of MIT and consultant to Bird, on research relating to rotating flow and centrifugal separation. Over 10 new technologies, numerous publications, and patents have resulted from the analytical, experimental, and computational research effort of the R&D team. Dr. Leung became quickly the leading authority in the world on separation and centrifugal technologies delivering courses and keynote speeches worldwide. He authored the book – Industrial Centrifugation Technology, published in 1998 by McGraw-Hill, NY, USA. The text has been used as an important reference for all those involved in any aspects of centrifugal separation.\nBiotechnology and Biopharmaceutical Separation – In 2004, Dr. Leung started his own company Advantech Company in Sherborn, MA, USA focusing on biotechnology separation of drug substances and biopharmaceutical separation of proteins in recombinant protein harvest from bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells for production of Monoclonal Antibody. He also developed classification know-how for classification and separation of fine particle by size and mass on kaolin and calcium carbonate suspension for high-quality papers.\nAcademic Experience:\nIn Aug 2005, Dr. Leung joined Mechanical Engineering Department of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as Chair Professor of Innovative Products and Technologies.\nResearch Institute of Innovative Products and Technologies:\nIn December 2005, he found and became Director of the Research Institute of Innovative Products & Technologies for PolyU with 20 professional staff, including 3 academic Assistant Professors, several engineers and supporting staff. Jointly with the departments of Electronics/Electrical/Mechanical/Computing Engineering, Applied Biology and Chemistry, Rehabilitation, Bioinformatics, Land Survey and Geo-Informatics, Design, and PolyU’s Industrial Centre. The Research Institute under leadership of Prof. Leung developed technologies and products related to healthcare for aged and disabled people using innovative and interdisciplinary approach to meet the unmet needs of the Society. The Research Institute has demonstrated very successful in the interdisciplinary approach led by Prof. Leung during the trial period 2005-2011 and served as road model for subsequent research institutes found subsequently in PolyU.\nSince 2011, Prof. Leung continued as Chair Professor of Innovative Products and Technologies in Mechanical Engineering Department of PolyU. He has a diversified background and equally diverse research interests in science and technologies related to energy, environment, health, and innovations. Prof. Leung’s current interests are listed below:\n(A) Nanofiber Technology Platform\nOrganic, inorganic, and biological materials can be electrospun into nanofibers 50-300 nm in diameter providing as much as 66 m2cm-3 of material. Nanofiber technologies have been applied to solar cells, air/gas filtration, air/gas purification, water purification and treatment, health applications and developing innovative technologies.\nNano-Energy\nNanofiber for Perovskite Solar Cells\nPerovskite crystal structure\nGraphene nanofibers have been introduced into the perovskite layer to produce perovskite crystals of large uniform size with high crystallinity, that harvest visible light from 350 to 800nm. The nanofibers provide nucleation sites and crystal growth. Further, photogenerated electrons can travel along the super highway offered by the graphene nanofiber to the electrode. As a result, the maximum power conversion efficiency reaches 19.83% and short circuit current reaches a high of 24.4mAcm-2.\nNanofiber for Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC)\nDSSC is one of the most environmental friendly solar cells due to colorful, low cost, using materials that are readily available, transparent which can be used on windows and does not take up space, and good efficiency. Despite these advantages, improvements can be made on performance.\nThe world of colorful Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (source: Google)\nThree technologies have been developed in our group to harvest light, trap light and transport electrical charges for the DSSC:\nTwo complimentary dyes were used to harvest light, each having their light absorption range. As a result, the entire visible light spectrum can be harvested using the dual dyes. Further, TiO2 nanofiber was used to replace the TiO2 nanoparticles for better electron transport. The first dye was coated around the nanofiber in a thin layer while the second dye, also in thin layer, wrapped around the first dye. Both dyes harvest light independently. The photogenerated electrons from the second dye is being transferred to the first dye. The photogenerated electrons from the first dye together with the electrons from the second dye are both transferred to the conduction band of the TiO2. This cascade transfer in electrons or generally in energy provides the solar cell a high PCE of 9.48%, which is 48% higher than the conventional DSSC with only a single dye.\nCascade energy transfer for cosensitizing DSSC with double core-shell structure\nA second technology that has been developed for DSSC is the bilayer nanofiber photoanode. Instead of using a layer of nanofibers with small diameter (SNF) for light harvesting, a second layer of nanofibers with larger diameter (BNF) adjacent to the SNF layer is used concurrently for light scattering so that light can be scattered and trapped in the photoanode. The PCE can reach 9.5% with this technology. The work was published in Advanced Materials with high citations.\nBilayer Photoanode DSSC\nA third technology that research our group have developed on DSSC was to insert carbon nanotube (CNT) completely in the truncated nanofibers (see diagram c below) such that they can be highly conductive. As such, photogenerated electrons can be transported efficiently to the electrode reducing the chance of recombination via (a) electrons recombining with sensitized dye, (b) electrolyte in the photoanode, or (c) at the TiO2 particle-particle interface. The PCE can reach a high value of 10.24%. The work was published in Advanced Materials again with high citations.\nTiO2 nanorods with embedded CNT for DSSC\nAlternatively, graphene can also be used and inserted in the TiO2 nanofibers with diameter 60-70nm. The PCE registered between 9 and 10%, which is 22% higher than the conventional device without graphene. Further, a thicker photoanode of over 23 micrometers can be realized as compared to conventional which is typically no more than 13-15 micrometers. This facilitates thicker photoanode for use in DSSC that can harvest more light as well as electrolytes that are more suitable for use in thicker photoanode.\nTiO2 nanofibers with embedded graphene for thicker photoanode DSSC\nNano-Environment\nNanofiber Filter for air filtration\nFiltration of nano-aerosols using novel nanofiber filters (from CNN News and New York Times reports)\nCNN News\nNew York Times\nPollutants are largely due to vehicular emissions, power plant emissions, and atmospheric reaction. Recent measurements made in Hong Kong near the cross-harbor tunnel revealed a large amount of submicron aerosols, especially aerosols less than 100 nm (also known as nano-aerosols or ultrafine particles) which are attributed to vehicular emissions and atmospheric photochemical reactions. This is consistent with testing that our group have performed in the lab also on nano-aerosols predominantly less than 100nm with aerated sodium chloride solution.\nNano-aerosols by virus of their small size can be inhaled easily into our lung from which they enter our cardiovascular system leading to various respiratory and cardioascular problems. Filters made of\nnanofiber from polymeric materials (left) can effectively filter the nano-aerosols (see right figure) up to 90%. However, the pressure drop can be very large. We have developed multilayer nanofiber technology wherein the same amount of nanofibers to achive a given eefficiency has been redistributed from a single layer into multiple layers. This ensures the pores in the fiber mat to be wide open. This is especially advantageous for producing wearable face mask that stops infiltration of viruses from infectious diseases (from common cold to more severe viruses SARS, H1N1, H5N1 etc.) as well as nanoparticle pollutants from diesel/LPG vehicle emissions. This can also be used in indoor air filter to remove submicron and ultrafine particles as well as cabin filter of motor vehicles protecting health of passengers. By engineering the nanofiber technology (design, configuration, material) accordingly, the capture target (i.e. spec filtration efficiency) of a given submicron particle size under a given challenging velocity can be achieved, see efficiency vs. size for different amount of nanofibers installed in the filter.\nNovel technologies developed:\nMultilayer Nanofiber technology – A quasi-3D structure with wide open pores to achieve high efficiency and low pressure drop\nCharged Electret Nanofiber – Charged electret nanofiber filter that provides high efficiency while reducing pressure drop, high quality factor exceeding 0.1Pa-1 across all challenging aerosols size. Charges stay in filter for at least 3 months in humid environment without decay.\nPortable filter testing – Portable filter test developed that proves nanofiber can effectively captured real nano-aerosols from vehicular emissions and atmospheric photochemical reactions\nComposite filter – Filter can capture nano-aerosols over extended period with high capacity, low pressure drop, and high efficiency even during initial period.\nNanofiber photocatalysts for breaking-down harmful gases in air and harmful organics in water\nPhotocatalyst function\nAs the photocatalyst, primarily TiO2 with wide-band gap, is being irradiated by light, electrons are excited and jump from the valence band to the conduction band. Electrons can combine with the oxygen in air to form super-anions, while the holes in the valence band can combine with the water vapor in air to form hydroxyl radical. Both the superanions and hydroxyl radicals break down by oxidation the harmful adsorbed onto the photocatalyst.\nA suite of nanofiber-based photocatalysts have been developed targeting at effectiveness, reduction of recombinations, and operating under visible light:\nTiO2 composite nanofibers with hierarchy structure reducing separated electrons-holes from recombination\nHarvest UV and vis light unlike TiO2 which harvest only UV light (~5% light spectrum)\nPhotocatalyst integrated into flexible and rigid surfaces, washable and cleanable\n3X more effective than conventional gold standard TiO2 nanoparticles of 25nm (P25) in formaldehyde breakdown\n7X at least more effective than conventional gold standard TiO2 nanoparticles of 25nm (P25) in NOx conversion\nBreakdown poisonous 0-xylene gas\nCan be used for face mask and air purifier\nBreakdown harmful organics in water (proven extremely effective for Methylene Blue dye and Rhodamine dye) much more effective than TiO2 nanoparticles of 25nm (P25)\nNano-Innovations\nNanofibers of composite semiconductor with embedded Graphene\nWe have developed semiconductor nanofibers with embedded graphene that can be used for photonic devices such as solar cells and photocatalyst applications.\n(B) Rotating Microfluidics Platform\nMicrofluidics can simulate many chemical and biological processes taking place at a micro-scale. This brings the lab processes to a more controlled environment requiring very small sample. It is convenient for point-of-use diagnosis. By rotating the microfluidic platform in a certain way, we can carry out further separation by centrifugal acceleration and mixing by secondary flow thus intensifying the process. When mixing is intense, this facilitates cell culture and even cell lysing. We are interested in both continuous as well as batch mixing in this research. Fig. 5a shows mixing in a rotating chamber due to continuous angular acceleration of a chamber generating complicated vortices in a 3-D manner providing effective mixing.\n(Left) Batch mixing in microfluidics, (Right) mixing in continuous feed through a T-channel.\n(C) Centrifugation\nCentrifugal separation of a solid from a fluid involves rotating the bowl at high rotation speed generating centrifugal acceleration acting on the heavier phase, which gravitates toward the bowl displacing the light phase toward the axis. Unexpected phenomena and flow pattern can result in a centrifuge with complicated fluid dynamics. By understanding these phenomena, better centrifuge design and operation can be developed with improved process results.\nThin boundary layer observed on rotating pool from special illumination.\nOur interest in centrifugation encompasses the following:\n(D) Water and Wastewater Treatment\nWe are interested in innovations in water and wastewater :\nWater Treatment:\nForward & Reverse osmosis\nNanofiltration\nUltrafiltration\nAdsorption\nOxidation\nLamella Sedimentation\nWaste Water Treatment:\nMembrane Bioreactor\nHigh-Solids dewatering by centrifugation and Filter Press\n(E) Healthcare Devices and Delivery\nWe are interested to develop healthcare devices and software that can help patients and elderly through product enabled services and process innovations. This may include but not limited to intention-driven robots, electrical stimulation devices based on pain sensing, decision support system, innovative wound dressing, etc.\nSelected Recent Publications\nY Li, WWF Leung*, “Introduction of graphene nanofibers into the perovskite layer of perovskite solar cells,” Chemsuschem, doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201800758, 2018.\nY Li, WWF Leung*, “Conditioning Lead Iodide with Dimethylsulfoxide And Hydrochloric Acid to Control Crystal Growth Improving Performance of Perovskite Solar Cell”, Solar Energy, Vol 157, pp 328-334, Nov 2017, doi:10.1016/j.solener.2017.08.011.\nKKS Lo, WWF Leung*, Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells with Shear-Exfoliated Graphene Solar Energy, Solar Energy, 180, 16-24, 2019.\nLJ Yang, WWF Leung*, “Electrospun TiO2 Nanorod with Carbon Nanotube for Efficient Electron Collection in Dye Sensitized Solar Cell”, Advanced Materials, 25, #12, 1792-1795, Mar 25, 2013\nLJ Yang, WWF Leung*, “Application of a Bilayer TiO2 Nanofiber Photoanode for Optimization of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells”, Advanced Materials, 23, #39, 4559-4562, Oct 18, 2011\nLJ Yang, WWF Leung*, JC Wang, “Improvement of Light Harvesting in Dye Sensitized Solar Cell Based on Cascade Charge Transfer,” Nanoscale, 2013, 5 (16), 7493-7498 DOI:10.1039/C3NR01868G, 2013\nLJ Yang, JC Wang, WWF Leung*, “Lead Iodide Thin Film Crystallization Control for High-Performance and Stable Solution-Processed Perovskite Solar Cells”, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 2015, 7 (27), pp 14614–14619.\nQQ Sun and WWF Leung*, “Charged PVDF multi-layer filters with enhanced filtration performance for filtering nano-aerosols”, Sep. and Purif.

  "text": "Awardee Profiles: Ir Prof. Yuen Pak Leung Miss Lui Ka Wing, Winky Dr Wang Lei, Bruce \nProf. Yuen is currently an executive of the Hospital Authority overseeing the design, construction and operation of the engineering infrastructure in public hospitals including the two mega-scale 10-year hospital development plan projects. Under his stewardship, the hospitals adopted a number of innovative engineering measures covering also energy savings to lower carbon emission and received the “Regional Energy Project of the Year Award” by the US Association of Energy Engineers for three consecutive years. He had been WHO and UNOPS advisor for constructing isolation facilities in the Republic of Indonesia, and provided voluntary engineering support to Szechuan Earthquake hospital reconstruction works.\nA veteran hospital engineer and an expert in the specialized hospital ventilation system, Prof. Yuen Pak Leung is a well-known figure in the industry. During his 40 years of hospital engineering service, he had fought several battles against the pandemics encountered by both SARS and COVID. With his wit and expertise, he was able to overcome the challenges by devising isolation facilities in hospitals within a short period, thus keeping the spread of the virus in check.\nDuring the outbreak of SARS in 2003, there was a serious shortage of isolation beds in hospitals. Prof. Yuen came up with a brilliant yet simple and fast track idea of adding exhaust fans strategically in general wards which serves to create inward airflow for installing isolation effect. After SARS, he did research and continued to steer the renovation of the ventilation system with a view to transforming general wards into isolation facilities with negative pressure functions. The number of isolation beds in hospitals thus significantly increased from 177 to over 1,000 within a short period. He also developed the world’s first-of-its-kind convertible design, which allows these isolation wards to be easily changed back into general wards under normal circumstances, which greatly enhances the flexibility in the deployment of wards. During COVID to timely cater for the rapid rise in infected, he made further inventions to swiftly turn general wards into Tier 2 isolation facilities, and converted exhibition halls into large scale Community Treatment Facilities (CTF), as well as the first high standard isolation ward in MiC form for immediate deployment in CTF. Appointed by the HKSAR Government, he is chairing the Working Group on Implementing the Requirement on Air Change or Air Purifiers in Dine-in Restaurants under Cap. 599F across over 18,000 eateries in Hong Kong. \nInternationally, he is current Deputy Chair of the Seoul Accord, Deputy Chair of the International Engineering Technologists Agreement (IETA), and the Vice President of CIBSE UK. Although Prof. Yuen has already stepped down from the post of the President of HKIE, he has insisted on realizing the ambition he had for HKIE during his tenure - “Believing is seeing - Innovation for transformation”. He firmly believes only with innovation we can find our way forward and ensure the sustainable development of Hong Kong.\nMiss Winky Lui has been devoting to voluntary services at various professional institutions with an aspiration to uplift the image of engineers and draw an influx of the younger generation, especially women engineers, into the industry in the foreseeable future by actively promoting STEM/STEAM education and fostering innovation technology and knowledge exchange.\nWinky was the Chairlady of the Organizing Committee of the Future Engineers Project (FEP) 2019, a half-year STEAM youth nurturing programme jointly organized by the Education Bureau of the HKSAR Government, PolyU Faculty of Engineering and 7 professional institutions (IMechE, ASHARE, IET, ASCE, IGEM, AES and HKIPE). She led the team of over 40 volunteers towards the successful completion of the programme. As an ambassador of the Women In Science & Engineering (WISE) Programme of IET Hong Kong and a member of the Ladies Engineering Team of HKIE MMNC Division, she acts as a role model to share her experience and vision in a number of career talks and workshops to inspire students, especially girls, that engineering is a prosperous career suitable for girls to pursuit. Furthermore, Ms. Winky Lui has spared no efforts in fostering the exchange of innovation technology both locally and globally, and facilitating the continuing professional development of engineers by organizing a wide range of conferences, symposiums, seminars, study tours and technical visits. \nTo recognize Winky’s personal achievements, contributions and commitment to the engineering community, she has been awarded the Young Woman Engineer of the Year 2019/2020 – Merit Award from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Hong Kong. Besides, she achieved the Trainee of the Year Award 2017 presented by The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE) as a recognition to her training achievements and contributions to HKIE and Hong Kong Society as a young engineer.\nDr Wang Lei started his undergraduate study in Mechanical Engineering with full-scholarship in 2006 and obtained his BEng with First Class Honors in 2010 from PolyU. Dr Wang has always been interested in renewable energy technologies. His interest and passion were strongly cultivated in the dynamic study environment in PolyU and drove him to continue his further study. He then completed his PhD research in new energy storage technologies in 2014 in HKU.\nDr Wang founded EcoFlow in 2017 and has been serving as the company’s CEO. Under his leadership, EcoFlow has developed into a national high-tech enterprise and is recognized as a unicorn company backed up by Sequoia and Hong Kong Foundation X with a valuation of over one billion USD in 2021. Dr Wang has obtained a total of 111 authorized patents and published 8 research papers in the field of batteries and energy storage. Since the foundation of EcoFlow, Dr Wang has led the team to carry out research and development with the mission to reinvent the way the average people and families access energy, and has been committed to building EcoFlow into a leading renewable energy solution provider across the globe.\nEcoFlow is dedicated to the development of portable power and clean energy products, launching two product lines – RIVER and DELTA, to meet the power needs of various scenarios, including home backup, outdoor recreation, and professional work. In 2021, EcoFlow released the world’s first portable home battery – the EcoFlow DELTA Pro, which was named in TIME’s list of 100 Best Inventions of the year. Till now, EcoFlow has delivered clean energy solutions to over one million users in more than 100 markets. Today, through the constant commitment into developing innovative renewable energy ecosystem, EcoFlow has become an important participant in the world’s mission of carbon neutrality, endeavoring to foster a carbon-neutral lifestyle for every individual and household to participate in daily life.\nMotivated by Dr Wang’s great passion on pursuing social good and environmental protection, EcoFlow has been actively practicing the social responsibility by giving back to the communities across the world. During the COVID-19 outbreak, EcoFlow donated over 1,000 portable power stations to mobile cabin hospitals in Wuhan, providing safe and reliable power supplies for medical treatments and daily lives of doctors and patients. In 2021, EcoFlow donated dozens of portable power stations to help alleviate the elderly’s urgent need of power during the snow storm in Texas US. In March 2021, EcoFlow initiated a long-term reforestation fundraising campaign for the Million Forest Plan, an ecological project jointly initiated by the United Nations Environment Program, the Climate Organization, and the China Green Foundation. As of now, EcoFlow has planted over 10,000 trees in the name of our users in China.",

ITC also provides additional full financial support for this project for up to 4 research talents including research assistants (up to HK$21,000 per month) and postdoctoral research fellows (up to HK$32,000 per month).\nSemantic understanding of traffic environments is important to ensure safe driving of autonomous vehicles. It can tell a self-driving car which pixels correspond to free spaces or obstacles in the pictures taken by an on-vehicle visual camera, so that the car can effectively avoid obstacles and safely navigate. However, the current semantic understanding solutions usually use RGB visible-light cameras. When the ambient light is insufficient at night, or there are glares caused by on-coming headlight, the existing solutions are difficult to produce satisfactory results. To address this problem, this project proposes to design a solution based on adaptive fusion of RGB and thermal images, so that robust semantic understanding could be achieved in complex day-and-night environments.\nIt is very encouraging to see young scholar from our department to be funded by important funding of ITC to conduct research in cutting-edge technologies.",

  "text": "Dr Ruan Haihui, Associate Professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at PolyU, has received an industrial support of 5 million HKD from the Biel Crystal (HK) Manufactory Limited for collaborative research on precision glass manufacturing. \nThe upcoming technologies have called for more usage of curved cover glasses in many areas including smartphones, wearable electronics, VR/AR glasses, and electronic vehicles. Such needs stem from the fact that human-machine interfaces must be transparent and anti-scratch. While glass covers can be thermoformed to have curved profiles that suit such needs, precision glass thermoforming is still extremely difficult owing to various quality issues arising from the lack of detailed know-how of the manufacturing process and in-depth knowledge in glass science. \nIn the past decade, the development of a manufacturing process for curved glass covers was extremely time-consuming and costly owing to enormous trials and errors; therefore, an upgrade to a computation-based process development protocol is urgently needed. To lay such a foundation for the industrial partner and the glass manufacturing industry, we establish the Biel-PolyU Glass Research Joint Laboratory (伯恩光學 - 香港理工大學玻璃研究聯合實驗室) to develop:\ncomputational models that predict stress buildup, relaxation, and deformation in chemical strengthening, \ncomputational protocols that assist the design of molds to compensate form errors due to shrinkage and chemical strengthening, and \nnovel molding materials and mold manufacturing technology that keep the transparency of thermoformed glass and ensure high-volume production.",

The project was concerned with designing a remote acoustic control method for health services through online conferencing software.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our society in various ways. Healthcare services with a face-to-face setting are urged to search for a new delivery mode in order to ensure the safety of clients and providers. When using various video conferencing software, we often encounter different sound responses and limitations. Users' computers also have various sound performances. These restrictions greatly affect the accuracy and reliability of the health assessment or therapy. In this project, a low-cost processor was used to design the platform such that service providers could remotely play the desired audio files on the client's side without suffering from the loss of sound in terms of frequency range and loudness due to the video-conferencing software. Experimental results showed that this remote control of audio playback could be realized with a low-cost processor called microcontroller unit (MCU) based on pattern recognition on client incoming audio frequency and it was able to deliver the audio files accurately in terms of frequency and amplitude.\nThe Young Professionals Exhibition & Competition (YPEC) is an annual event organized by the Younger Members Section of the Institution of Engineering and Technology Hong Kong (IET Hong Kong).

Alongside with new technology development, Prof. Leung together with Avalon has transferred a nanofiber technology, which has been licensed earlier to Avalon, for the immediate need of developing a highly protective facemask for professionals working in railroad environment. This is especially vital during the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nA new clean room for class 8 under ISO 14644-1 has been built in MTR Siu Ho Wan Depot in 3 months to accommodate several facemask production lines that have incorporated nanofibers into the facemasks. The produced facemasks are provided to over 17,000 MTR employees in Hong Kong. Protecting the health of MTR employees is very important as they serve nearly 6 million Hong Kong passengers riding the rail daily. This is also the first clean room ever built by the railroad service provider in the world to produce facemasks for their employees.\nThe technology adopted by MTR is based on the nanofiber filter technology developed by Prof. Leung’s R&D group in ME since 2006. The nanofiber facemask has been certified for the ASTM level II standard with PFE (particulate filtration efficiency) and BFE (bacterial filtration efficiency) both exceeding 98% by certifying agency. In fact, the PFE and BFE of the nanofiber facemask are above 99% in the certification testing. Further, the nanofiber facemask can also capture 20-60 nm nanoaerosols with filter efficiency of 95-98%. Also, the facemask can be used in dirty environment with high aerosol loading. Not only the facemasks offer high protection against tiny invisible aerosols and airborne viruses, the pressure drop for the facemasks are relatively low providing comfort to wearers. All these merits are extremely beneficial for railroad operators and professionals.\nProf. Leung has also helped to set up quality assurance and quality control to ensure all the produced facemasks in the MTR Siu Ho Wan Depot clean room meet the stringent requirements per ASTM level II certification. This ensures the nanofiber technology is well transferred into a sound and useful product that benefit the Hong Kong community.",

  "text": "FANG Jieyichen\nPhD in Mechanical Engineering\nSupervisors: Dr JIAO Zengbao & Prof. FU Mingwang\nResearch interest: High-temperature alloys\nResearch work: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are newly emerging advanced metallic materials with unique microstructure and excellent mechanical properties. In contrast to conventional alloys with one primary element and several minor alloying dopants, HEAs typically contain four or more multiple principal elements. Precipitation-hardened HEAs, especially those strengthened by coherent L12-nanoparticles, have enabled a new space for the development of advanced structural materials with superior mechanical properties at both room and high temperatures. From the application and processing points of view, there is a temperature-rise and down period which will affect the entropy contribution and solid solubility. Therefore, understanding phase stability and transformations at intermediate temperatures is crucial for tailoring microstructures and mechanical properties of L12-strengthened HEAs. In this study, the crystal structure, morphology, chemical composition of nanoscale precipitates and matrix of L12-strengthened HEAs at different temperatures were systematically investigated through scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, atom probe tomography, and thermodynamic calculations. Our results reveal that L12 precipitates can be formed at all the studied temperatures, but their morphology change as the aging temperatures decreases. In addition, the matrix structure changes from fcc-type to bcc-type upon long-term annealing at relatively low temperatures. The microstructural evolution and phase transformations of these alloys were discussed from the thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. This research not only sheds light on fundamentals of phase stability and transformations at intermediate temperatures but also provides guidance for microstructural control of L12-strengthened high-entropy alloys.\nSHI Xingyi\nPhD in Mechanical Engineering\nSupervisor: Dr AN Liang\nResearch interest: Fuel cells\nResearch work: In the last decade, the rising demand for the utilization of renewable energy has drawn more and more attention to energy conversion and storage systems. Among various energy conversion systems, direct liquid fuel cells (DLFCs) with their high energy density and facile fuel storage have received increasing attention. However, most of DLFCs must use noble metal catalysts for liquid fuel oxidation reactions, but yield limited fuel cell performance, greatly hindering their widespread application. Recently, an electrically rechargeable liquid fuel (e-fuel) system, typically consisting of an e-fuel charger for energy storage and an e-fuel cell for power generation, has attracted worldwide attention.1 Compared to the conventional alcoholic liquid fuels, this liquid e-fuel offers three major advantages including: i) good rechargeability, ii) high electrochemical reactivity even on carbon-based materials; and iii) good cost-effectiveness and durability.\nHere, we report a power generation system, direct liquid e-fuel cell,2 consisting of a catalyst-free graphite-felt anode and a conventional oxygen cathode separated by a proton exchange membrane, resulting in a maximum current density of 750 mA cm−2, a peak power density of 293 mW cm−2, and an energy efficiency of 42.3% at room temperature, which is much higher than the performances achieved by conventional direct liquid fuel cells, as shown in Fig. 1. This emerging technology, capable of fast recharging, could be a powerful, efficient, cost-effective, and durable power generation device, showing great potential for commercialization in the future fuel cell electric vehicle industry (Fig. 2).",

IJMTM is the top one journal in manufacturing with the impact factor of 8.019.\nThe paper entitled “interactive effect of grain size and crystal structure on deformation behavior in progressive micro-scaled deformation of metallic materials” was published in IJMTM in January 2020 and reported the findings of the interactive effect of grain and geometry sizes and crystal structure on the process behavior, performance and the quality and properties of the parts made by the unique deformation-based micro-manufacturing process. It also summarizes the development of an innovative process and the scientific understanding and insight into the nature of the effects of microstructure and geometrical sizes and the crystal structure of materials to provide a basis for process innovation and process and quality optimization. This research is a hot topic in micro-manufacturing as it involves multi-disciplines covering micro-mechanics, materials and manufacturing sciences. The journal of IJMTM selects four best papers from all the papers published in the journal each year to be featured as the cover of the journal and each cover is used for three months. The paper to be featured by the journal comes from the NSFC key project with the funding of RMB 3 million of which Prof Mingwang Fu is the principal investigator of the project.\nNowadays, micro-manufacturing has become an important manufacturing process for making micro-scaled parts and structures to meet the huge demands from different industrial clusters due to the upward trend of product miniaturization. Micro-forming is one of the micro-manufacturing processes to be widely used in industries for its high productivity, low cost and good properties of the fabricated parts and structures. However, there are many unfathomable and bottlenecked issues from different aspects including innovative process development, process parameter optimization, product quality assurance and properties tailoring. On the other hand, it is very difficult, if not fully impossible, to leverage the data, information and knowledge developed in the traditional macro-scaled manufacturing to micro/nano-manufacturing since they are not fully valid in the downscaled domains. Successfully addressing these issues needs to have an in-depth understanding and scientific insight into the physical essence and nature of the process. The paper published in IJMTM aims at addressing these issues and providing a basis for large-scale application of the process.\nRead more at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2019.103473.

  "text": "1 / 3\nWhen we press and pluck the strings of a guitar, it generates different types of acoustic waves. How those waves sound is decided by how we pick those strings and the strings’ nature properties such as length and thickness. The principle here is that wave radiation depends on both the intrinsic properties of the source and the eigenstates of its surrounding environment. This has laid the foundation to explore and exploit various physical phenomena in a wide range of wave systems. The evolving understanding of this paradigm has inspired countless breakthroughs in wave-matter interaction related fields ranging from mechanics and acoustics to optics and photonics. A long-held belief of wave-matter interaction is that an emitter always radiates into and interacts with the eigenstates that exclusively define the surrounding environment. Even in non-Hermitian systems featuring exceptional point(s) where two or more eigenstates coalesce leading to an incomplete eigen-basis in the Hilbert space, this was still deemed to be valid previously as the wave function associated with the missing dimension of the Hilbert space has not been observed in any physical system.\nResearch team led by Dr Jie Zhu, Associate Professor of the PolyU Department of Mechanical Engineering, conducted collaboration with Prof. Ren-min Ma’s team from Peking University, Prof. Li Ge’s team from City University of New York and other colleagues. They show that the above-mentioned century-old tenet can surprisingly break down at an exceptional point. With investigation on difference classic wave systems, the researchers experimentally demonstrated a chirality-reversal phenomenon in a whispering gallery mode cavity where the excited unidirectional wave circulation exhibits opposite handedness to the coalesced eigenstate. This striking yet extensively existed phenomenon were confirmed in both acoustic and electromagnetic wave systems.\nTheir finding, for the first time, reveals that the radiation field of an emitter can become fully decoupled from the eigenstates of its environment. Such counter-intuitive phenomenon transforms the fundamental understanding of wave-matter interaction and enriches the intriguing physics of exceptional points hidden behind source-eigenstate interplay. In acoustics, it could contribute to a board range of research fields, including non-Hermitian acoustics, noise control and abatement.\nThis work has been recently published online on Nature Physics [ “Revealing the missing dimension at an exceptional point”, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0807-y ].

The project has been implemented under a close collaboration with industrial sponsors from Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou etc, which contribute with not only in-cash support about HK$450K but also facilities, materials and necessary equipment, under an ambitious commercialization plan, and now comes to a new stage with industrial prototypes done, top journal papers published, and patents filed or to be filed.\nVehicle vibration can lead to serious occupational problems to professional bus/truck drivers, including lower back pain, muscle fatigue, spinal column disease, digestive system diseases and other cardiovascular system effects. The related occupational safety and health issues have therefore attracted many social attentions in recent years from trade unions, doctors and governmental departments (Fig01).\nThe commonly-used practice for vibration suppression in most buses, trucks or coaches relies only on a built-in suspension system of vehicles when they were produced, and there is no any specific method for the healthcare issue. Although driver seats can be specially designed, most have no effective consideration on vibration suppression. Importantly, existing vibration isolation or suppression methods are often not working well due to a number of reasons (low performance or high cost), and this further creates a serious and challenging issue to the area of vibration control (Fig02).\nTo solve these technical challenges and to address important social concerns, this project is to develop new generation vehicle seats, targeting effective and cost-efficient methods for improving occupational health of professional drivers (Fig03). New vehicle seats will be designed with an innovative award-winning bio-inspired nonlinear anti-vibration technology, which can achieve a special nonlinear stiffness beneficial to vibration control, and the novel anti-vibration mechanism is embedded in existing seat design which leads to no instalment and arrangement changes to existing seat structures. New vehicle seats can be adaptable to different payloads and would provide on-line alarming or assessment on historic and current sitting health. This project would provide a benchmark and unique product in this area solving the mentioned problems, and the developed anti-vibration technology in this project would also bring significant benefit to many other engineering areas for vibration isolation and suppression.",

Dr Anthony Law, Adjunct Associate Professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, in collaboration of the Campus Sustainability Office and Department of Building Services Engineering of PolyU jointly developed a novel “Rapid indoor air quality and electricity usage monitoring system”. By installing sensors and releasing tracer gas at locations like wet markets and restaurants, the system can automatically track and analyse airborne transmission path of viruses. The system was piloted on campus in early 2020 and will be used in the community through collaboration with local green organisations.\n理大最新研發空氣監測系統 助疫情下追蹤空氣病源\n【橙新聞】 10 Sep 2020\n理大研發新空氣質素監測系統 可推算室內病毒傳播範圍\n【Now新聞台】 2 Sep 2020\n理大研發新空氣監測系統 可推算室內新冠病毒傳播範圍\n【頭條日報】 2 Sep 2020\n理大研發室內空氣質素監測系統 可分析食肆換氣率及污染物走向\n【香港01】 2 Sep 2020\n理大研發空氣質素監測系統 可用於餐廳街市追蹤污染物\n【明報】 2 Sep 2020",

  "text": "Developing untethered soft robots with programmable configurations is of great value yet a grand challenge in robotics. Recently, this challenge has been successfully attempted by a research team led by Dr Haimin Yao, Associate Professor from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), jointly with Dr Tao Chen, Professor from Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nThe research team started with the transferring of a layer of stacked graphene assembly (SGA) on a polyethylene (PE) substrate. The as-prepared SGA/PE bilayer exhibits curling behavior upon the variation of temperature (Fig. 1a, d). More interestingly, if an SGA/PE bilayer is pre-treated with a tempering process (heating followed by cooling) in a constrained space, it will coil spontaneously into a roll when it is freed (Fig. 1a-c). Surprisingly, the PE layer now is wrapped inside the SGA layer, which is opposite to that of the un-tempered sample. Such unusual morphing behavior of SGA/PE bilayer was found attributed to the asymmetric elastoplastic property of the SGA layer as demonstrated by the molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. 2a, b).\nIt is the asymmetric elastoplastic property of SGA that allows them to prepare a variety of morphing systems with programmable initial morphologies (Fig. 3). These structures can be further assembled to construct more complicated actuation systems, such as artificial mimosa (Movie 1). More importantly, the tempered SGA/PE roll can achieve rolling locomotion under infrared lighting, resulting in an untethered light-driven motor (Movie 2).\n“Our work not only demonstrates an alternative strategy in creating untethered soft robots and reconfigurable devices but also provides a new philosophy for fabricating 2D material-based smart materials and structures,” said Dr Yao.\nThis work has been recently published in Nature Communications [“Asymmetric elastoplasticity of stacked graphene assembly actualizes programmable untethered soft robotics”, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18214-0]. Ms Yang Gao and Mr Anran Wei, two PolyU ME PhD graduates are the co-first authors and Dr Yao is one of the corresponding authors.",

Hong Kong is no exception due to severe pollution from traffic emissions and the transport of pollutants across the border. The aerosols are dominated by submicron aerosol sizes less than one micrometer/micron and nanoaerosols of less than 100 nanometers. Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 virus) leading to the COVID-19 pandemic that has paralyzed the entire world in magnitude far beyond anyone’s imagination is in the same size category. Unfortunately, failure to recognize one of the modes of transmission by air of the coronavirus and its variants by the health authorities, experts, and the General Public leads to widespread disease and deaths globally during the first half of 2020 and in some cases even as of today. The book provides strong definitive evidence collected worldwide on the air transmission mode of the virus from residence, hospitals to laboratories. The virus is 60-140 nanometers and when attached to a carrier, it can be easily airborne. The book also provides nanofiber technologies on how the airborne virus can be effectively filtered. The book is written in layman’s language in 14 chapters, 533 pages, covering “fundamentals, deeper understanding, technologies, and applications”, with questions and answers at the end of each chapter. It is suitable for 3rd and 4th year undergraduates, or graduate courses, with contents related to pollution control, aerosols, fluid engineering, material sciences and engineering, and health technologies.

  "text": "Ir Dr Curtis NG (Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University) collaborated with Ir William AU (General Legislation Division of Electrical and Mechanical Services Engineering, HKSAR Government) (EMSD), Avaron Technologies Limited and Anlev Elex Elevator Limited to develop a smart mechanism of “Artificial Intelligent Nylon Optical Fibre Sensing Escalator Combs”. The project achieved an outstanding result at the 2021 Inventions Geneva Evaluation Days, winning a Gold Medal. By making use of 3D scanning and printing technology, a conventional escalator metal comb has been transformed into an A.I. monitor using optical fiber sensing and artificial intelligence cloud analysis technology. This real-time detection technology via mobile applications has greatly reduced the occurrence of escalator accidents.\nSafe and reliable escalators are essential to maintain efficient accessibility and functional vertical transportation in Hong Kong. Escalators offer tremendous convenience to our society. Breakdowns in escalator operation induce unexpected delays in daily activities and user discomfort. Therefore, ensuing escalator safe operation is of premier concern. According to the statistics of escalator incidents, apart from passenger behaviour, the major factor in most of the cases is the intrusion of small foreign objects such as screws and coins into gaps between combs and step treads, causing collision damages and injuries. The objective of this project is to reduce unnecessary escalator incidents and passenger injuries.\nThe project started with re-engineering the escalator comb design by 3D scanning technology, then the simulation and adoption of new nylon material by multi-jet fusion (MJF) 3D printing technology to enhance its mechanical properties, especially for its ductility and resilience. The feature of the warning message “Mind the Steps” has been printed on the comb surface to attract public safety awareness. In a pilot test, the excellent resilience nylon combs successfully bounced all 8 screws from the escalator step to the platform. In the test, the intrusion of screws did not cause any failure of the nylon combs.\nTo summarize, the main advantages of the re-engineered 3D printed nylon combs are:\nless possibility of intrusion or trapping of foreign objects due to redesign for minimizing comb clearance;\nlower risk of high-energy fracture and ejecting of broken metallic pieces because of the use of ductile and compliant MJF 3D-printed nylon; and\nadditional freedom (with almost negligible cost) to have tailor-made features (e.g., reduced clearance, different colors, the addition of alert message) due to the MJF 3D printing technology.\nThe recognition ME achieved is not only a testament to the Department’s research excellence, but also demonstrates the strength of ME in transforming research breakthroughs into real-world solutions.",

  "text": "1 / 2\nMechanical behaviors are traditionally investigated with closed Hermitian systems. However, the Non-Hermiticity, such as the energy loss or gain, is everywhere when we study an open system that has energy exchange with the environment. In acoustic systems, the loss of sound energy to other types is generally treated as write-off. But if such loss or gain components can be intentionally designed and arranged, we may be able to turn waste into treasure, and realize non-conventional sound modulation such as topological sound energy and information guiding or localization.\nRecently, research team led by Dr Jie ZHU, Associate Professor of the PolyU Department of Mechanical Engineering, collaborate with Dr Baile ZHANG’s team from Nanyang Technological University, to bring non-Hermiticity design together with topological insulator in acoustic system. They present the first experimental demonstration of a non-Hermitian route to higher-order topology in an acoustic crystal. Specifically, a two-dimensional acoustic coupled resonator lattice that is incorporated with deliberately introduced losses has been designed and constructed. Through direct acoustic measurements, the sound energy is highly localized in the corners and edges of the topological insulator structure at specific frequencies, which are hallmark features of the higher-order topology. This finding points to a fundamentally new direction beyond the framework of conventional topological physics and offers the possibilities for actively steerable topological wave manipulations. It may help the development of new acoustic sensor, detecting network and system.\nThis work has been recently published in Nature Communications [“Non-Hermitian route to higher-order topology in an acoustic crystal”, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22223-y].

  "text": "Guest Speaker: Dr WANG Zhe, Walter\nAssistant Professor, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\nDr Wang’s current research is about human-building interaction and building energy system control. Prior to joining HKUST, he was a Project Scientist in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working on smart building control. Zhe has published 73 articles in SCI journals, 23 as first author, 8 as corresponding author, 6 as the co-first author. He has first authored 1 ESI highly cited paper and 2 Applied Energy highly cited papers. Recently, Zhe has won the first prize in the 2022 Global AI Challenge for Building E&M Facilities hosted by Hong Kong EMSD.\nWith higher renewable penetration, demand side management becomes increasingly important to help maintain the real balance between supply and demand, and to help the grid absorb more renewable generations. Buildings are a major electricity end-user, which has large potential for demand response. However, the current rule-based control cannot unlock the demand response potential of buildings. In this talk, we will introduce how model predictive control can facilitate more efficient dynamic energy management, and help building respond to the grid signal in a more effective way. We will prove that battery management can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. We will also demonstrate that model predictive control is robust to model and prediction uncertainty. To achieve our carbon neutrality goal, a new building control paradigm, i.e., model predictive control rather than rule-based control, is needed.",

Afterwards, she worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab as the ALS Postdoctoral Fellow. She was working at the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering, Caltech from 2015 to 2016 as a Visiting Faculty. After joining HKUST, Prof. Chen received the Early Career Award for the GRF grant and continuously awarded 6 GRF grants. She was awarded the Simon Fellowship by Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK in 2019 for her contribution to the design of complex materials. The research of Prof Chen’s group integrates the theories of mechanics of crystalline solids with advanced structural characterization methods and algorithms to develop new phase-transforming materials having desirable properties. She developed in situ nanomechanics experiments and theoretical approaches for phase transforming polycrystals with much enhanced fatigue resistance. These materials have emerging applications in medical devices, and energy conversion devices.\nFor micro and nano-devices used for biomedical applications, e.g. neural stents and heart valves, both crystallographic compatibility and grain boundary engineering play profound role in their functionalities. But these two mechanisms are not well synergized. Here we theorize a two-tier compatibility criterion to optimize the textures across the grain boundary, to enhance the mechanical reversibility of transforming polycrystals under stress-induced phase transformation. In this talk, I will present an experimental demonstration that a micropillar fabricated at the grain boundary achieves a remarkable transformability under the demanding driving stress (~600MPa) over 10,000 nanomechanical cycles without fulfilling the crystallographic compatibility condition by lattice parameters. The experiment provides an important insight to the design of low fatigue materials by considering the orientation dependent compatibility between grains. By modern nanotechnologies, it is possible to fabricate bi-crystal, tri-crystal and/or quart-crystal nano structures with designed textures, which underlies a new method for the smart materials and structures design.",
