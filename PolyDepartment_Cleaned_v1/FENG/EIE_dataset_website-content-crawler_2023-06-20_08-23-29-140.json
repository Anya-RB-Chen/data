We built distributed multi-agent face recognition system for kindergarten desiring to help parents to protect kids. We trained the quadruped robot based on Deep reinforcement learning for legged robotic control problems. Those things are so cool and will be the treasure in my life.\nI was delighted to receive the MSc Studentship from EIE to support my study and life at PolyU. Now, I am a Research Assistant here, focusing on reinforcement learning and robotics. Thanks to my teachers, classmates, EIE staff, and PolyU again.\nIn the study, I met so many problems since I never did any experiments related to the optical field. Thus, I always discussed with some lab-mates and read professional books for some knowledge. Meanwhile, in the weekly group meetings, I usually reported my research progress or shared some excellent papers. In this process, I learned more knowledge about optical fiber sensing, and my English skill is also trained.\nFinally, I completed my dissertation project successfully and published part of the content at the OECC conference. In addition, I also led our team’s project to join some competitions under the support of Prof. Changyuan Yu. We got the First Prize in the 6th IoT Technology and Application 3S Competition for University Students in China (第六屆大學生物聯網技術與應用「三創」大賽) in 2020 and the Second Prize in the 7th Hong Kong University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition in 2021. In the future, I will work as a Research Assistant in Prof. Yu’s group. I hope I can further develop myself in the latter research study.\nAfter the first semester study with a high GPA, I got an opportunity to take MSc Studentship Project Scheme with my MSc dissertation. For the latter 1.5 years, conducting research project and writing the paper were my main tasks. Different from the course-based study, academic research requires strong self-learning and problem-solving skills. I spent lots of time to go through relevant papers and understand the principles and algorithms. When facing an issue, I would split it into several aspects and resolve them step by step with the guidance from my supervisor at EIE. That becomes my valuable academic experience, and I am proud of myself who firmly chose the research project at that time.\nI obtained language assistance from the English Language Centre and obtained interview guidance offered by the Office of Careers and Placement Services at PolyU, which help me a lot both in my study and career. I am very grateful for the generous dedication and consistent support of PolyU and EIE during my study.\nAfter studying hard in the first semester, I had the opportunity to do my dissertation with a studentship under the supervision of Prof. Lam.

In addition, the group meeting held every week assisted me to keep up with the latest research. Also, I was given a chance to present an interesting paper in a research group meeting, which allowed me to practice speaking in public. During my dissertation, I encountered problems from time to time, which always puzzled me for a while. Nevertheless, through these valuable challenges, I forced myself to work through the problems, and this nurtured in me the valuable habits of reading and thinking.\nThe academic atmosphere in EIE is strong and I have been greatly enriched in terms of knowledge and working ability. I especially appreciate this learning experience, which taught me how to be positive and face up to challenges. It is definitely a worthwhile experience, and new students are always welcomed in EIE.\nDue to the excellent academic results of full GPA, I was offered a studentship to undertake the dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Mak. Compared with the coursework-based study that learning is a passive mode, doing research requires both strong initiatives and learning capabilities. In the progress of accomplishing my dissertation, I encountered lots of issues. However, it was these tough challenges that forced me to dig into the root of the problems and taught me how to think about the same problem from different perspectives. Through this valuable research experience, I have realized that it is of great importance for me to keep learning to strengthen the adaptabilities to rapid advances in new technologies. I strongly recommend new students to choose the dissertation if they are really interested in doing research.\nDuring my studies in EIE, I have enrolled in seven courses which are generally on telecommunications and artificial intelligence. What impressed me most was that each course basically has a mini project. Through accomplishing these projects, you will not only better understand the meaning of those complex formulas and theories, but also gradually learn how to exploit the knowledge to solve practical problems.\nAfter the first semester of fundamental knowledge, I was able to choose the dissertation in the field of autonomous driving in the second and third semesters under the supervision of Dr. Ivan Ho. Dr. Ho helped me a lot and gave me many valuable advices during my research. Especially, the weekly meeting of our group enabled us to get inspirations from each other. In some ways, choosing the dissertation was a bit challenging. However, on reflection, when looking back after one year, I can honestly say that it was one of the best decisions that I have made, and it prompted me to make significant progress in research ability. Overall, I am sure that the study experience at PolyU will become great assets to my future.\nDuring these two years, I got the chance to learn the state of the art technology of different fields from different subjects. I also met foreign classmates whom have different cultural backgrounds and some local experienced people from the industry. My social network is therefore expanded. Beside learning from the taught subjects, I had the chance to work on a research project which allowed me to do research on my MSc dissertation. Although I faced different challenges doing this project, I enjoyed working on it since the project enhanced my research experience and skill. It is definitely helpful to my working ability as well as my future study in PhD.\nI am XU Siyuan, after the graduation from the MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering programme in 2016, I became a PhD candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE), where I investigate High-level Synthesis in Approximate Computing. My supervisor is Dr Benjamin Carrion Schafer.\nIn September 2014, I was admitted as an MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering programme student in PolyU. In the University, the medium of instruction is English, this frustrated me a lot at the very beginning as I was not used to it. But with the help of classmates and teachers, I finally conquered the problem and I found that I fall in love with PolyU as the University and the EIE Department provides me lots of helps and impetus.\nThere is a 24-hour studying room in the library where we can discuss with our classmates about the study and free WIFI in the whole University, it is extremely convenient. Also, I like the sport facilities in PolyU, especially the gym and the swimming pool. They help me to relax and release pressure after study.\nWhen you have questions in the classroom, you can raise your hand immediately and the professor is always delighted to solve your problem. Also, after classes, you can go to the professors’ offices, they are willing to help you no matter for study or life. Therefore, I want to thanks Dr Carrion Schafer. Under his guidance, I have learned not only academically but also personally a lot.\nIt is my great honor to become a student in PolyU. I am grateful to The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering for their generous and consistent support during my master’s study.\nApart from taking taught subjects, I also chose the dissertation track. The Department is very generous to grant me a studentship to support my dissertation work. Learning a topic via writing a dissertation is quite different from course-based learning. Rather than simply attending lectures and finishing assignments, taking dissertation involves more interactions between you and your supervisor. Besides, it requires you to articulate your ideas clearly orally and in written form. Thanks to the patient guidance and the encouragements from my supervisor, I was able to produce some good results and publish an international conference paper at the end of my MSc study. We also received an invitation from the conference organizer to submit an extended version of our conference paper to a special issue of an international journal.\nDuring the time working on my dissertation, I found myself quite enjoying doing research work, and the academic environment in EIE is congenial and vibrant. Therefore, after graduated from the MSc programme, I decided to continue my research in EIE as a research assistant and planned to start my PhD study in August 2016.\nIn the first semester, I took five subjects in the field of digital signal processing and pattern recognition. The lectures were theoretical and helped me form a firm basic knowledge structure. Those lab sessions were not only closely related with theories but also kept pace with state-of-the-art techniques and products. I found them very useful when I tried to understand and implement complicated algorithms later on in my study and work. Our department has large amount of online and offline resources that make it possible to learn anytime and anywhere.\nIn the second and third semesters, I was devoted to doing research project and writing my dissertation. My supervisor, Dr Daniel Lun, guided me well through the way. He is a hardworking learned man and always ready to help me solve research problems. We held a meeting every week and took turns to give presentations. I could show what I was doing and ask for suggestions, frequently got inspirations from other group members. Those presentations extended my view and stimulated my passion of researching and exploring. Such an environment of mutual learning helped me progress rapidly. The dissertation offered me a chance to conclude my study and discover promising prospects. I've not only gained professional knowledge, but also achieved communication skills and researching experience.\nMy name is Jessie Chen, who started the study in the MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering programme in 2013. During two year's study in the EIE Department, I really harvest a lot from the classes and my research work. Through my great effort, I got 3.9 GPA in the first semester and won the chance to take my thesis with full studentship in the latter 3 semesters.\nThe study life here is totally different from which I have experienced in mainland China. It emphasizes more on understanding rather than just remembering equations. Usually, I spent a lot of time working on the theory of different courses instead of doing numerous exercises. The course here really trains a person's logical thinking ability, critical thinking ability and problem-solving ability. On the other hand, the research work here really tests a student's creativity and perseverance. After your study here, you will find yourself being more mature, confident and intelligent, and being proud of what you have paid out during your study life.\nWish every new comer good luck in the coming semester!\nDuring this programme, I had the opportunity to attend lectures delivered by extremely capable and knowledgeable academics. I have acquired a strong foundation in advanced engineering technologies and practical problem-solving skills through course work, laboratory exercises and mini-projects. The 9-credit dissertation has equipped me with research experience, critical thinking and independent learning ability. I was also delighted to receive a studentship from EIE for taking the dissertation and was honoured to receive the EIE Alumni Scholarship and Type I Scholarship from the Faculty of Engineering.\nI am satisfied with my study life at PolyU, which turned out to be full of knowledge and challenges. I feel honoured to be an MSc in EIE graduate and I very much treasure this intensive and diverse learning experience.",

  "text": "EIE\nThe Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE), formerly known as the Department of Electronic Engineering, was established in 1974. The Department was renamed in 1998 to reflect on the evolution and emergence of new technologies in the discipline during the previous years. Now, in the 21st century the Department pursues a wide range of research activities in many areas of electronic and information engineering. With the ultimate aim of producing preferred graduates who will meet the needs of society, the Department is committed to provide high-quality education to students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The Department strives for excellence in research and aims to produce high-impact research outputs that are relevant to industry and society.\nMission\nEnsuring continual and sustainable development of teaching and research activities, and maintaining these activities at the highest attainable standard.\nProviding quality taught programmes and all-round education to students.\nPursuing international quality research in key selected areas.\nMaintaining and refreshing a research portfolio of current and topical importance.\nEstablishing collaborative relationship with industry and professional community.\nKey goals\nResearch\nTo develop a research agenda that will be a flagship across the region and beyond.\nTo raise and attract research funding from various sources including governmental and non-governmental bodies as well as industries in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland.\nAcademic Programme, Learning and Teaching\nTo articulate the identity of EIE programmes to help our students better understand their career path and the emphasis of their study.\nTo address the emerging needs of the society and the industry by regularly modernizing the contents of our programmes.\nTo develop a caring learning and teaching environment to address the study needs of our students.\nPublicity and Communication\nTo develop strong connections with international academic communities and industries to facilitate deep collaboration.\nTo have an effective communication network with secondary schools to understand the needs of the prospective students.\nProgrammes\nThe Department offers full-time and part-time taught courses leading to the awards of Higher Diploma, Bachelor degrees, Postgraduate Diploma and Master’s degrees, in electronic engineering, and full-time Bachelor degree programme in the information technology disciplines. Research programmes are offered by the Department leading to awards up to doctoral level. Programmes bearing the same title of awards reach comparable standards irrespective of the mode attendance. The Bachelor degree in electronic and information engineering (full-time) has been accredited by The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.\nTeaching\nQuality teaching is the Department's first priority. Incorporating modern curricula and the latest educational technologies, the Department provides the most up-to-date technical and professional training to students.

Effective quality assurance systems are in place to constantly refine details of the operation of the programmes so as to ensure the key education objectives are met.\nThe Department's teaching activities are organized into three broad technical areas, namely,\nComputer and Information Engineering,\nCircuits and Microelectronics, and\nCommunications Engineering.\nAccordingly, staff members are grouped into three sections, each corresponding to one of the above broad technical areas. Subjects taught by the Computer and Information Engineering Section include, signal processing fundamentals, multimedia applications, image and speech processing, video technology, inter alia, digital systems, computer programming, computer architecture, linear systems and control theory, instrumentations, fuzzy control, artificial intelligence, software engineering, information systems, and distributed systems. Teaching areas of the Circuits and Microelectronics Section include, inter alia, circuit theory, analogue electronics, integrated circuits, solid state physics, power electronics, computer-aided design of circuits, electromagnetic compatibility and product design. Finally, the Communications Engineering Section is responsible for the teaching of, inter alia, communication fundamentals, propagation, RF and microwaves, digital communications, information and coding, data communications, and wireless communications.\nResearch\nSince the 1980’s, the Department has been rapidly expanding its capability in high-level research and development. While applied research is the Department’s major focus, staff members have also actively pursued fundamental work. With four decades of diligence, the Department has established itself as a major contributor in many research areas and excelled in certain areas of strategic importance. Research groups or centres have been formed within the Department and at the University level to encourage collective efforts to conduct cutting-edge research in respective areas and pursue large-scale projects with external research bodies. At present, the Department has reorganized its research activities into three major Research Focus Areas: \"Artificial Intelligence and Robotics\", \"Future Wireless Networks and IoT\", and \"Photonic Systems and Devices\". The Research Focus Area leaders and members are all active in their respective fields, and constantly take part in professional activities such as journal editorship, book review, technical review of periodicals, participation at technical forums, organization of conferences and workshops, etc. The Photonics Research Centre (collaborating with members from the Department of Electrical Engineering) has been recognized as one of the niche areas by the University.\nThe Department’s research has been actively supported by the University’s research funding.

  "text": "The “AI and Robotics” group has been engaging in facial image analysis with research on face detection and recognition, facial image super-resolution and enhancement, facial expression recognition, etc. This comprehensive research on facial image analysis supports a wide range of applications, including security and access control, human-computer interactions, augmented reality, virtual reality, education, entertainment, etc. For face recognition, the group has also conducted research on low-resolution face recognition, high-resolution recognition, and age-invariant face recognition. This makes face recognition applicable, even if the target faces are small in size, such as for video surveillance, and have a large age gap with the corresponding faces in the database. The group has also researched various algorithms for facial super-resolution and enhancement. This research has led to the support of two Innovation and Technology Funds, with a total fund of more than HK$ 4 million. One of the ITF projects is for performing movie restoration and enhancement for a local movie manufacturer. Currently, we are investigating the generation of high-quality 4K movies based on video super-resolution techniques. In addition to restoration and enhancement, we are also conducting research on violence detection and the prediction of violence levels in movies, pornography detection, etc. \nThe group has also conducted research on facial expression recognition for recognizing facial expressions from images and videos and has proposed a new research direction, namely, facial expression recognition for comprehension. The research on facial image analysis has been supported by 11 grants from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, with total funds of about HK$4.5 million. Both the number of journal papers and conference papers, published in this area, is more than 60.\nOur proposed spatial-temporal geometry-guided framework for facial expression recognition from videos.\n\nMatching pairs of faces based on pore features extracted from high-resolution face images. A large number of matched pore keypoints can be established between face images of the same identity.

  "text": "World population is expanding rapidly and new technologies must be developed to grow food to feed this ever-increasing population. In order to produce a more stable and sustainable food supply for the global population, environmentally optimized food growing technologies that will not be affected by climate change, contaminated environment and shortage of fresh water are required to replace traditional farming practices.\nThrough innovative research and development of effective photosynthetic-active-radiation lighting system, hydroponic and aeroponic irrigation systems, network sensing and novel environmental control, optimized growth profiles and renewable energy system, we explored and developed high performance IoT-assisted plant cultivation systems that can be integrated into urban buildings for sustainable and stable food supply. Compared to the existing systems, our system provides additional features:\n1. Improvement of food safety by a fully automatic process.\n2. Programmable photoperiod and light intensity with specific wavelengths to promote growth.\n3. Optimal growth environment for different plant species using IoT sensors and an automatic control system.\n4. Provision of research platform for developing optimal growth profiles with automatic data collection and analysis.\n5. Plant nutrient control using a computer controlled nutrient feeding technique.\n6. Flexible installation for urban environment with modular and scalable design.\n7. Reduction of water consumption by 95%.\nWith a generous funding support of HK$4.478 million from the Innovation and Technology Commission and Pong Yuen Holdings Limited, the project team had successfully developed a prototype of multistorey growth rack with an effective photosynthetic-active-radiation lighting system, both hydroponic and aeroponic irrigation functions, and fully automatic nutrient monitoring and calibration system. The team later deployed 60 of these growth racks to a specially constructed 3000 m2 modern hydroponic farm in Ta Ku Ling with a monthly production capacity of 6000 vegetables. In addition to the smart growth light and nutrient monitoring and control systems, these racks are equipped with various IoT sensors and wireless sensing network for plant monitoring and climate control. Advanced IoT sensing techniques enable a comprehensive monitoring of environmental parameters and vegetable growth status with which big data analytics have been applied to identify the optimum growth profiles of different vegetables. The platform is a successful demonstration of how IoT technologies can be deployed to achieve smarter farming and yield better crops through IoT-assisted data-driven optimization of the crop growth processes.\nThe farm is now a regular supplier of high-quality vegetables to the Vegetable Marketing Organization (蔬菜統營處). In December 2018, the farm has been certified an Accredited Farm by the Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (漁農自然護理署). Internationally, several awards have been received by the project team in recognition of their scientific contributions. These awards include the Silver Medal in the International Invention Innovation Competition (Toronto, 2016), Merit Award in the 18th China Hi-Tech Fair (Shenzhen, 2016), as well as Gold Medal with Jury’s Congratulations and IFIA Best Innovation Medal in the Silicon Valley International Invention Festival (California, 2019).",

The availability of Internet-of-Things technologies enables us to collect virtually any data that are useful to our decision making from virtually anywhere, while artificial intelligence and information engineering provide the powerful computational tools for analyzing the collected data intelligently and efficiently to provide us with firmly grounded rationale for decision making. To take advantage of these technologies, various hardware and software systems are required to be closely interconnected through very complex information networks, thus posing security risks when a massive amount of data and information flows through these networks. It is therefore vitally important to protect and safeguard them against various forms of cyber attack. The Scheme encompasses three programmes that are aimed at training professionals who are interested to work in the three closely related and mutually supporting technological areas mentioned above, namely, (1) electronic systems and Internet of Things; (2) artificial intelligence and information engineering; and (3) information security. Depending on their own areas of interest, students admitted into the Scheme are allowed to choose to specialize in one of these three areas. \nStudents admitted to the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)/ Bachelor of Science (Honours) Scheme in Information and Artificial Intelligence Engineering study together during the first year and then complete their preferred programme (one of the above three programmes), normally within three years.

  "text": "Mobile communication networks (also called cellular communication networks) were first deployed in the 1980’s. Over the past four decades, they have evolved from the first generation (1G) analog networks, to 2G digital networks (e.g., GSM and CDMA), and then to the subsequent 3G and 4G networks. During this period of time, other wireless technologies such as WiFi and Bluetooth have also emerged and advanced continually. While these mobile/wireless networks were originally designed for human-to-human communications (e.g., voice call) or human-to-machine communications (e.g., video streaming and online games), they have recently been heavily used for machine-to-machine communications (e.g., remote sensing, fleet management, Internet of Things (IoT) devices).\nAccording to the reports published by Statista, the number of mobile users worldwide is estimated as 6.8 billions in 2019, and is forecast to increase to 7.33 billions in 2023. Over the same period, the number of IoT devices will increase from 26.66 billions to 51.11 billions. To fulfill the ever increasing demands (e.g., more users, higher download speeds, shorter time delay) from a wide range of applications (vehicular communications, augmented reality, smart city, smart factory), the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks have begun their commercial deployments in 2019. Moreover, the largest deployment is seen in China, where the number of 5G users is predicted to be 110 millions by 2020.\nThe “Future Wireless Networks and IoT” Focus Area at the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering aims at researching fundamental problems related to 5G and beyond networks as well as IoT devices. Research topics include cybersecurity, vehicular networks, channel coding, Edge AI, etc. The team is very active in teaching, research as well as professional society activities. The team receives research funding from the Hong Kong government, the China government, and industrial partners such as Huawei. The team also carries out consultancy works for the Hong Kong government (e.g, Highways Department and OGCIO) and the industry (e.g., HKJC). The team members are briefly introduced in the following,\nPhotonics underpins various engineering applications in energy, imaging, sensing, communication, nanotech, advanced manufacturing and biomedical applications. Traditionally, photonics as a discipline of science is a large field of study on its own that probes the most fundamental aspects of nature with profound consequences to humanity. As an enabling technology, photonics is typically subsumed under the fields of communication, energy, imaging to name a few and each respective sub-field of photonics is itself a growing area of research.\nPolyU has a long track record of research excellence in optical communications, sensing, energy, imaging and other biomedical applications. The group collaborated extensively with the industry with numerous world-record breaking experiments, technology commercialization and spin-off companies. Various research facilities have been established including fibre draw tower and high capacity optical communication system testbed.\nThe “Photonic Systems and Devices” Focus Area at the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering aims to study key devices and systems for energy, imaging, sensing and communication applications. The key members and their research areas are introduced in the following.",

  "text": "Optical fiber is an indispensable part of our digital age. It enables high capacity wired and wireless broadband connectivities that allow us to have fast access to many broadband services. Recent studies have shown that global Internet Protocol (IP) traffic has increased by fourfold in the past five years and the annual global IP traffic will pass the Zettabyte (1 zettabyte = 1 trillion gigabytes) threshold by the end of 2017[1]. This requires us to develop transmission techniques that can cope with this ever increasing traffic demand. The only possibility is communication technology based on optical fiber. \nIn the past few years, the “Photonic Systems and Devices” Research Group at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University have worked closely with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., the global leader in information and telecommunication solutions, to develop optical communication technologies that enable the realization of multi-terabit optical networks. In particular, we have developed transmission and detection techniques as well as related digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm that allow the realization of 400Gbit/s per wavelength transmission (total capacity of a few tens of Terabit per fiber) over a few thousand kilometers[1]. In addition, the transmission techniques and DSP algorithm we have developed enable the implementation of flexible modulation formats and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) grid which are essential for next generation flexible optical networks. We have also developed techniques for monitoring key network parameters that will add intelligence to future optical networks. This shall enable significant increase in the utilization of the capacity of future optical networks[2]. \nAnother research focus of the Group has been on intra- and inter- data center short-reach optical communication systems. The ever-popular broadband and cloud services such as Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, WhatsApp and Dropbox means significant amount of data traffic will be generated within and between data centers. Unlike long-haul optical communication systems which typically cover distance of a few thousand kilometers, the required transmission distance of short-reach optical communication systems is much shorter, typically a few km to a few 10s of km. However, the amount of transmission and receiving devices involved are much more. To meet the demand of short-reach optical transmission systems, we have been developing techniques that allow high-capacity and low-cost transmission over short distance. We have developed a number of transmission schemes that allow 100Gbit/s transmission using 25Gbit/s optical devices[3,4]. The work carried out has not only enabled us to produce high quality publications in leading journals in the area but also contributed to the solutions for industrial applications.\nReferences:\n[1] Zhou, X., Lu, C., Lau, A.

The developed system won the gold medal in the International Trade Fair Ideas and Inventions New Products (iENA) in Germany in 2019, and the gold medal in the International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva in 2021. An indoor solution provider, Blue Pin (HK) Limited, was founded by one of our doctoral graduates in 2018. The company has licensed our cooperative indoor positioning technologies for various site deployments in Hong Kong and mainland China. These include the InnoCentre of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation at Kowloon Tong (a three-storey 15,000 m2 area), the AsiaWorld-Expo in Hong Kong (a two-storey 15,000 m2 area at the east lobby), the Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center (SZCEC) for the HKPCA and IPC Show in December 2018 (Halls 2 and 4 up to 22,500 m2), and a shopping mall in Guilin, China (seven-storey up to 200,000 m2) . \nBased on the success of our study on cooperative positioning and its real-world deployments, our group further explored the possibility of exploiting wireless channel state information (CSI) for indoor positioning and wireless sensing in IoT, which can achieve cm-level indoor positioning accuracy with a single anchor point only. Specifically, we are working on improving the robustness of such system under the influence of dynamic indoor environments via machine learning techniques. The corresponding localization techniques can be deployed on robots for cm-level indoor navigation, e.g., construction robots that require a high positioning precision. We are currently working on a joint research project on construction robots with industry, universities, and research institutes in Hong Kong and mainland China, funded by the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (GDSTC) via the GDSTC Key Technologies R&D Programme (~RMB 16 million). Recently, we are extending the CSI-based wireless sensing techniques to human activity recognition and people counting problems, and some research results have been published in prestigious journals (e.g., IEEE Internet of Things Journal [1]) and conferences (e.g., ACM MobiHoc). Our wireless sensing-based self-quarantine monitoring system [2] also won the Championship of the Tertiary Education Category in the Hong Kong Electronics Project Competition 2022 organized by the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE). In 2022, we signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with The Kowloon Motor Bus Co. (1933) Ltd. (KMB) for research collaboration in a Smart Traffic Fund (STF) project (HK$ 1.35 million) funded by the Transport Department on CSI-Learning-based Passenger Counting System on Public Transport Vehicles. \n[1] D.

  "text": "The “AI and Robotics” group has been engaging in spoken-language and audio signal processing research with applications to voice biometrics, next-generation human-computer interaction, and healthcare. We have developed far-field speaker verification systems and multi-lingual speaker diarization systems for Huawei Technologies Corporation and collaborated with Tencent AI Lab to advance deep speaker-embedding algorithms. Our deep-learning algorithms enable voice biometrics systems to work in adverse acoustic environments. The group also has significant contributions to healthcare research. In particular, we have developed patient-specific ECG classifiers that can monitor the health of patients with arrhythmias. We are the first group to rank and discover Cantonese features for detecting patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Since 2018, our work has been supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong, Huawei, and Tencent, with total funds of HK$5 million. \nThe group also developed new active noise cancellation (ANC) technologies for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It was found that 70% of children with ASD experienced hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli, and their abnormal behaviors influenced their daily lives. Cooperated with the Department of Health Technology and Informatics and the Department of Mechanical Engineering of PolyU, the group developed a headset with tunable noise cancellation technology for ASD children. The technology includes the design of an ANC headset with an adaptive acoustics controller to suppress the sound at the frequencies that irritate the children most. It also has an adjustable control panel for fine-tuning the controller to suit the ASD children with different sensitivity to auditory stimuli. Over 200 ASD children were invited to participate in this research to obtain the typical auditory stimuli behavior of ASD children for the design of the ANC headset. The group received a total of over HK$4 million from The Innovation and Technology Commission to conduct the research work of this project. The group also received a donation of HK$5 million to set up the PolyU - Innovation Technology (HK) Audio and Speech Signal Processing Joint Laboratory for carrying out the experimental work of this and other related audio and speech processing projects.\nThe developed frequency tunable ANC headset and the control app for ASD children\nInauguration of the PolyU – Innovational Technology (HK) Audio and Speech Signal Processing Joint Laboratory\nY.Z.

The award recognizes the best tutorial paper published in any IEEE Communications Society magazine or journal in the previous five calendar years. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an enabling technology to engineer the radio signal propagation in wireless networks. By smartly tuning the signal reflection via a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements, IRS is capable of dynamically altering wireless channels to enhance the communication performance. It is thus expected that the new IRS-aided hybrid wireless network comprising both active and passive components will be highly promising to achieve a sustainable capacity growth cost-effectively in the future. Despite its great potential, IRS faces new challenges to be efficiently integrated into wireless networks, such as reflection optimization, channel estimation, and deployment from communication design perspectives. Dr Zhang provides a tutorial overview of IRS-aided wireless communications to address the above issues, and elaborate its reflection and channel models, hardware architecture and practical constraints, as well as various appealing applications in wireless networks. Important directions worthy of further investigation in future work are also highlighted in this winning paper.",

Having received a Bachelor of Science (Hons) degree in Physics with first-class honours from The University of Hong Kong in 1981, Professor Wai then went to the United States to begin his graduate study in physics and obtained his Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, in 1988. His thesis research was on the nonlinear propagation of optical signals in optical fibers. After graduation, he joined Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in McLean, Virginia, United States where he worked as a Research Scientist on the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) mission — a joint U.S.-Italy Space Shuttle project to study the release and retrieval of a satellite tethered to the Space Shuttle with a 20-kilometer long cable. There were two TSS missions: TSS-1 was flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis in August 1992, and TSS-1R was released in February 1996 from the Space Shuttle Columbia. Professor Wai studied the electromagnetic interaction of the tethered satellite with ambient space plasma.\nIn 1990, Professor Wai left SAIC and returned to the University of Maryland as a Research Associate in the Department of Electrical Engineering. There, he resumed his research on fiber optic communication focusing on transoceanic transmission, studying the impact of fiber nonlinearity on light propagation. He made important contributions to the study of interaction of polarisation mode dispersion and nonlinearity on high-speed optical fiber communication systems. He also studied photonics devices such as lasers and photonic switches.\nIn 1996, Professor Wai returned to Hong Kong to join the Department of Electronic Engineering of PolyU as an Assistant Professor. Together with PolyU colleagues, he established the Photonics Research Center and state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure for research in optical fiber communications, fiber-optics sensors and gallium nitride technology. The Center now boosts a specialty fiber tower that can pull novel photonic crystal fibers for research in cutting edge fiber technology. In Hong Kong, Professor Wai began his research on future optical network technology including all-optical packet-switching. He designed and demonstrated routing of optical information with all-optical processing of the packet header information. He has received seven U.S. patents on his inventions in optical packet-switching and other technologies. To recognise his contribution in optical communication and optical networks, Professor Wai was elected to the rank of Fellow by the Optical Society of America in 2009. In January and December 2012, Professor Wai elevated to IEEE Fellow and Fellow of the Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences respectively. With the approval of the State Ministry of Science and Technology, Professor Wai has been selected for the \"National Science and Technology Programmes Expert Database\" since February 2012.\nProfessor Wai is an active contributor to the technical field. He has over 160 refereed international journal publications. He has participated in the organisation of many international conferences in photonics and optical communications such as the Conference of Laser and Electro-Optics and the Optical Fiber Communication Conference. Professor Wai is currently an Associate Editor of IEEE Journal of Lightwave Technology.\nIn 2002, Professor Wai became Professor and Head of Department of the Electronic and Information Engineering. In 2005 he was promoted to Chair Professor of Optical Communications and Dean of Faculty of Engineering. In 2008, he also served as Associate Vice President.",

  "text": "Student and Graduate Stories \nStudying the Bachelor of Science in Internet and Multimedia Technologies programme gave me a solid foundation in computer science and multimedia processing. The solid foundation has enabled me to delve into complex systems and think critically.\nThe EIE Department provided many opportunities to let students apply theory to practice beyond the classrooms. I am glad that I was involved in RoboCon and VR contests during my study, in which I acquired technical skills and developed the mindset of a professional engineer. The academic environment also raised my interest in research. I was lucky to work with Dr. Bonnie Law, Programme Leader of BSc in IMT, in the Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scheme (URIS) programme to learn about the creation of knowledge. In addition, I also had an opportunity to be a research assistant and contribute in Prof. Wan-Chi Siu's research group during my study gap year. These experiences were precious and helped me to develop my interest in Computer Vision. I am now well prepared to pursue the master's program in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I firmly believe that my four-year study in this undergraduate programme has given me a head start on my career.\nIt’s been an honour to graduate from the Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE)* degree programme. The invaluable lessons I learned from all the professors, instructors and tutors greatly benefited me, as did the all-rounded facilities and support of the department.\nAn integrated project in the curriculum provided us with an opportunity to learn electronics. I had a chance to assemble a robotic car and programme it to track a line and complete various tasks. This project equipped me with solid knowledge of electronic components, embedded systems and programming skills.\nIt is very exciting to reach the final year, when a range of elective subjects are available. These include topics like computer vision, cloud computing and network security, which are highly related to modern technologies like AI, AWS and TLS, to name a few.\nIn addition to the technical foundations that this course provided, I had the opportunity to collaborate with talents from other fields. For example, my multidisciplinary manufacturing project required students from different fields to work collaboratively, and my multidisciplinary final-year project required students from different fields to work collaboratively on a larger-scale and more challenging project.\nWith the technical knowledge gained and all-rounded training received from EIE, I feel well-prepared to face the era of the metaverse.\n* Former programme title of BEng(Hons) in Electronic Systems and Internet-of-Things\nKWONG Ngai Wing, Titan - 2019 Graduate of the BEng(Hons) in Electronic and Information Engineering degree programme, currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the EIE Department, PolyU \nStudying in the BEng(Hons) in Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE) programme has increased and widened my knowledge in EIE.

It is a common and serious side effect of insulin therapy in patients with diabetes. The group proposed a system model to measure physiological parameters continuously to provide hypoglycaemia detection for Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) patients. The contribution include the design of: (1) A model of fuzzy inference system (FIS) for hypoglycaemia detection, and (2) An intelligent optimiser for the FIS parameters.\nStructure-Based Drug Design Using Computational Intelligence Techniques: Imbalanced datasets are commonly encountered in real-world classification problems. Re-sampling has become an important step to pre-process imbalanced data. A sampling strategy that is based on both over-sampling and under-sampling is proposed. The contribution is a hybrid pre-processing method (FRB+CHC) to re-sample imbalanced datasets that: (1) Creates the new samples of the smaller class based on fuzzy logic, and (2) Improve the datasets by the evolutionary computational method that under-samples both the minority and the majority samples.\nDistribution of the samples after over-sampling. The y-axis represents the values of z2 and x-axis represents the value of z1\nIdentification of protein-ligand binding site is an important task in structure-based drug design and docking algorithms. Different methods have been developed to predict the binding site. When scores are calculated from these methods, the algorithm for doing classification becomes very important for the prediction. The group propose the use of support vector machine (SVM) to cluster the pockets that are most likely to bind ligands based on selected attributes. The approach offers improved results over other well-known methods on the dataset LigASite and 198 drug-target protein complexes.\nA Computational Intelligence Based Classifier and its Applications: Microphone recognition aims at recognizing different microphones based on the recorded speeches. In the literature, Gaussian Supervector (GSV) has been used as the feature vector representing a speech recording, which is obtained by adapting a Universal Background Model (UBM). The team looked into GSV in detail. To improve the quality of the raw GSV, it is proposed that a kernel-based projection method that maps the raw GSV onto another dimensional space. The contribution include: (1) Confirming that GSV can outperform the averaged frame-level features, (2) Finding how GSV is affected by the UBM and other parameters, and (3) Separating the microphone response information and the speech information into different dimensions in the projected feature space for improved microphone recognition.",

In their works on 3D object measurement, efficient data-driven fringe projection profilometry (FPP) techniques were developed to improve the robustness of the 3D scanning operation. It was the first time that both the 3D information and 2D texture of the target object could be obtained by a single-shot FPP process. The team also made important contribution to the study of image reflection removal. New multiple-view and single-view image reflection removal algorithms were proposed. In these algorithms, the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network was used to effectively regenerate the background gradients for the reconstruction of the background image while removing the reflection image. For the work in vision-based place recognition, discriminative ConvNet features were adopted for the development of a place recognition method that can effectively search the scene database to identify the scene that best matches with the captured scene. The team also applies deep learning technique to structural health monitoring. By analyzing the electromechanical impedance (EMI) signals around a mechanical structure using a Convolutional Neural Network, its health condition can be predicted with an accuracy of over 90%.",

His current research interests are in the areas of multimedia content protection, image and video coding, privacy preserving image retrieval, intelligent content distribution and Internet applications.\nResearch highlights:\nMultimedia Content Protection: Dr Lo has been working on multimedia content protection for years. He has made contribution to the area of cryptanalysis of many different multimedia encryption techniques. Based on the findings of his cryptanalysis work, a number of image encryption techniques have been developed. Recently, he has derived a content adaptive joint image compression and encryption technique. Extensive experiments and security analysis are conducted to show the good compression and encryption performance of the group’s proposed encryption scheme. Currently, Dr Lo is working on developing encryption schemes for dedicated applications areas such as encrypted domain image processing schemes and privacy preserving image retrieval systems.\nPrivacy Preserving Image Retrieval System: In order to preserve the privacy of the owners of images, people tend to convert the multimedia data into unrecognizable data before uploading it to the cloud so that the content of the plain images will not be exposed to others even when the server is hacked. However, this arrangement is not compliant with plain-text based conventional information retrieval techniques. The relevant research work is trying to apply machine learning techniques to derive an effective way in measuring image features in encrypted domain and developing similarity measures for different features so as to facilitate efficient image retrieval for two classes of images: one requires high compression and computational efficiency but light protection like those images shared in various social networks, and the other class emphasizes on high security level for those high sensitive images like medical and military images.",

His current research interests include human face recognition, image and video processing, and computer vision.\nResearch highlights:\nMore than half of Professor Lam's publications are on face-image analysis and recognition. He has published many good technical papers, with good citations. In particular, he has proposed many different algorithms for tackling the problems of illumination, facial-expression, and pose variations for face recognition, as well as algorithms for face detection, facial landmark localization, facial feature extraction, etc. In recent years, he has focused more on research on low-resolution (LR) face recognition, where he proposed super-resolving facial features, rather than super-resolving the LR query face. By super-resolving facial features directly from the low-resolution query image, the estimated higher-resolution features are more accurate than those extracted from a super-resolved, distorted face image. >He also proposed an approach, which considers face super-resolution and recognition, simultaneously. These two tasks are related and can help each other. Considering them simultaneously can achieve better performances for both face super-resolution and recognition. He also proposed new research for high-resolution face recognition. His proposed idea is totally different from conventional face-recognition methods. Rather than analysing and comparing the facial features between face images for face recognition, he devised a method to detect pores in face images, and matching two faces using pore-scale features. The advantage of the approach is that the pore patterns are unique for different people, and this is sufficient to make an accurate decision by using a small facial skin region. He has also built a data set for learning pore patterns. Recently, he has also proposed various algorithms for age-invariant face recognition. In particular, feature-encoding methods have been applied to further enhance the robustness of deep features.\nA large number of the pore patterns from two face images of the same subject can be matched, but only a few pore patterns can be matched for face images of different subjects.",

His research interests include multimedia technologies, image and video compression, video transcoding, digital TV/HDTV, 3DTV/3DV, Multiview plus depth coding, machine learning for video coding, and future video coding standards including Versatile Video Coding (VVC), screen content coding, light-field video coding, and 360-degree omnidirectional video coding.\nThe current research focus of Dr Chan is Content-Aware Video Coding. Dr Chan and his group has witnessed the rapid developments of various video coding technologies in the past decade. Recently, many different types of new videos attract both academic and industry researchers into new application domains. It includes screen content video, light field video, 360 degree video, etc. The group’s present and future compression achievements gear towards different directions as shown in the below figure. The state-of-the-art video coding standards treat each video equally, and are content unaware. To handle a wide variety of different video characteristics, different coding units (CUs) within the same frame may be coded with different modes and be partitioned into different sub-blocks, which results in a huge number of different modes for handling different types of videos. The group believes that various types of video will have different characteristics. The idea is to adaptively exploit the features in various types of video by machine learning such that the coding framework can make very fast decision with negligible quality loss. It means that the group’s coding framework is now content aware. In the recent development, the group successfully designed online-learning-based Bayesian Decision Rule for fast intra mode and CU partitioning algorithm in HEVC screen content coding. The BDBR and complexity performance are now the best in the literature. The group then uses the decision tree, random forest and deep learning for SCC mode decision resulting in further BDBR improvement. These works are the first few researches using the learning approaches for coding the new screen content video. For other new video formats such as light-field and 360 degree videos, the group can further extent this concept to these application domains. Up to now, there is no work in these areas using the learning approach for coding these types of video. Dr Chan and his group believe that their current research is heading to a direction where fruitful results could be achieved in the development of the next generation video coding.",

Multimode fibers can be designed and applied as a promising alternative in imaging systems or devices to resolve the fundamental problems and achieve high resolution. The designed multimode fiber can have high numerical aperture by using a high contrast of refractive indices between fiber core and fiber cladding. Fiber with multimode method is designed and studied, therefore aperture synthesis approaches can also be investigated and applied to achieve super-resolution in the imaging systems or devices. Various imaging methods and microscopic technologies, such as digital holography, confocal microscopy, diffractive imaging and single-pixel imaging, will be studied and combined with a high-numerical-aperture multimode fiber. The designed multimode fiber can be used as illumination source in imaging systems to illuminate the samples, such as living tissues and cells. It is believed that the designed imaging devices or systems are highly desirable in various research and application fields, e.g., high-resolution measurement of biomolecules, living tissues, cells, and many complex environments (via endoscopes), and it can have a long-term impact on high-resolution biological imaging.\nAnother area of Dr Chen’s research focuses on optical lossless-data transmission, optical transmission security, and information optics. It has been well known that the data transmitted by using optical means could be affected by the propagation media, such as through scattering media. For a long time, it is always desirable that high-quality or lossless data transmission using optical means can be carried out in various complex propagation environments by using simple and effective approaches. High-quality data transmission using optical means will be investigated, and different complex wave propagation environments are tested. It is believed that the designed devices or systems can fully overcome the fundamental limits existing in optical transmission areas, and the strong industrial connection can be established.\nDr Chen has also conducted research related to information optics and optical lossless-data transmission, and has authored or co-authored more than 80 international journal papers and around 35 international conference papers (including many invited talks). Several published journal papers are ESI highly cited papers. The research work has been carried out to fully resolve the fundamental problems existing in practical applications related to optical imaging, optical lossless-data transmission and information optics. Dr Chen’s current research interest focuses on imaging systems or devices, computational imaging, information optics, phase retrieval, optical metrology, big data and deep learning for optical imaging, optical lossless-data transmission, and high-resolution biological imaging.\nHigh-quality single-pixel optical imaging through scattering media\nOptical devices or systems designed for secured lossless-data transmission",

  "text": "Professor Yu’s research group focuses on photonic devices, subsystems, optical fiber communication and sensor systems, and biomedical instruments, including 3 main topics: Carrier recovery in optical fiber communication system; Optical performance monitoring in fiber network; Optical signal processing/sensing using fiber. As a faculty member in Singapore and Hong Kong in the last 15 years, Professor Yu has secured over 7 million US dollars grants as the PI/Co-PI, and supervised 10+ postdocs and 20+ PhD students. Till 09/2019, he has authored/co-authored 6 book chapters, 400+ journal and conference papers (82 keynote/invited, including OFC2012 in the USA). His group won 6 best paper awards in conferences and the championship in biomedical area in the 3rd China Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition in 2014.\nAs an interesting example, his group has investigated the application of specialty optical fibers on vital signs monitoring. Healthcare has been drawing wide concern in modern society, especially in developing countries like China. Human health condition is usually assessed by some physical indicators, such as body temperature, respiration and heartbeat. Among these vital signs, respiration and heartbeat are the most widely used indicators. Respiration and heartbeat can reflect the working condition of lung and heart in order to pre-diagnose specific cardiac and pulmonary diseases. Thus, reliable as well as accurate monitoring on respiration and heartbeat has become more and more necessary, and various schemes have been proposed. Currently, wearable sensors like ECG devices for heartbeat monitoring, are the most popular methods and has been widely used in hospitals. However, these sensors require close contact or attachment on skin, which is not convenient to specific users like the elderly and children. Thus, contactless sensing schemes are drawing attention and one of them is the optical fiber sensor. Optical fiber sensor owns the advantages of high sensitivity, lightweight and electromagnetic immunity, which can be a potential candidate in healthcare applications. To explore its application on contactless vital signs monitoring, specialty optical fibers, namely few-mode and multi-core fibers are investigated in this work. Based on these two kinds of optical fibers, in-line interferometers are designed and packaged as smart mats under the mattress. The results show that vital signs signals can be detected in a contactless way, and both respiration and heartbeat ratio can be obtained with low errors. The smart bed with fiber sensor was selected to in the exhibition of the Gerontech and Innovation Expo cum Summit (GIES) in Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre in 2018, which attracted lots of visitors. Professor Yu’s group also won the silver award (out of 1916 competitors from China and overseas) in 2019 Guangdong College Students Entrepreneurship Innovation Competition, which was reported by Chinese media such as South Net and Guangdong TV.\nVital signs monitoring experimental setup\nThe smart bed with fiber sensor was selected to the exhibition of the Gerontech and Innovation Expo cum Summit (GIES) in Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre in 2018.",

Graduates of the programme will satisfy the academic requirements for Corporate membership of the HKIE.\nThe field of ICT offers enormous opportunities in Hong Kong and worldwide, particularly in information security. Corporations recruit ICT professionals to support their businesses by deploying new technologies. Further transition toward a knowledge society and the shifting of the ICT sector toward Cloud Computing and mobile communications will require ICT employees to acquire new skills and knowledge, particularly in the area of information security.\nSeveral recent employment surveys conducted in Hong Kong and worldwide reflect the need for manpower in information security. For example, the 2019 Robert Half Salary Guide shows that Chief Information Officers (CIOs) surveyed found it challenging to find qualified IT staff in IT security, Software/Application Development and Data/Database Management areas. Qualified technology professionals in Hong Kong are getting multiple offers since IT job opportunities are on the rise, promoted partly by the growth of mainland China companies investing and expanding into Hong Kong. Another salary survey, \"Hong Kong Technology Salary Guide 2019\" conducted by Robert Walters, echoed that demand is high for specialists in infrastructure and cyber security as companies need to review security policy and respond to the growing threat of cybercrime. A salary increment of more than 30% can be expected for technology job movers with niche/scarce skill sets related to information security. In summary, graduates of the information security discipline can expect very promising career prospects both locally and globally.",
