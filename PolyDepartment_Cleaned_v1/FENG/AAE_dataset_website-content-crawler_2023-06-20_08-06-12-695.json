  "text": "Many countries and regions have developed policies for the critical strategic development of UASs. Hong Kong, and mainland China, and the rest of the world are undergoing a revolution arising from “Smart City” technologies. Due to the high potential of the UAS in revaluating the industry, several research centres or institutes were built around the world. Lots of the industrialization are produced by the well-known robotics centres located in the UK, U.S, Germany, Singapore, and mainland China, with specialization ranging from field robotics, UAV, artificial intelligence, and human-robot collaborative systems. These investigated autonomous systems are mainly targeted at field applications and indoor applications, such as indoor service robotics.\nAs pointed out in the Outline of the Chinese 14th Five-Year Plan (中國十四五規劃重點), China will focus on the development of marine, maritime, shipping, and ship-related industries. Benefiting from the rich marine and shipping resources of Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area (GBA), RCUAS will launch the first UUV study within Hong Kong together with UAV and UGV, which is promising to form the land-sea-air integrated autonomous mobile systems.\nUAS is one of the most promising innovations, technologies in the industry 4.0 era\nIt is a global common belief that the development of unmanned system technologies has the potential to significantly improve efficiency and stimulate the economic growth of the world. In other words, UAS can transform the existing industries with new values. Autonomous driving technology and the large-scale operation of logistics and distribution, and the realization of low-cost and high-efficiency logistics and distribution are the inevitable trends of the future development of Hong Kong's logistics.\nHong Kong is strong in innovation, technologies, and start-ups\nFortunately, Hong Kong is the world-level pool that cultivates and attracts talents in innovation, technology, and start-ups. Lots of new ideas and prototypes are developed continuously in Hong Kong. Among those innovations, the UAS is one of the most promising and industry-needed sections. However, Hong Kong lacks space for manufacturing and testing to make all those innovations come true. \nGBA is strong in manufacturing, testing and industrialization\nIn fact, the GBA is famous for manufacturing, testing, and industrialization. The roles and connections between Hong Kong and the GBA are inseparable. Many successful examples in transferring the innovations from Hong Kong to GBA occur, such as the DJI for UAV and GOOGOL Tech for intelligent robots. Moreover, the GBA also provides many testing beds for UAV and UGV systems. \nThe PolyU RCUAS can lead to continuous impact to both Hong Kong and GBA\nFrom the holistic aspect, Hong Kong possesses a strategic position within the GBA and the GBA is famous in applications ranging from intelligent transportation to intelligent manufacturing which has a strong demand for UAS. In short, the UAS is required both locally by Hong Kong logistic industry and urbanization, and the GBA. The UAS research in Hong Kong can provide continuous talents, innovations, and technologies to GBA where all those technologies will be industrialized and come true.",

  "text": "Abstract\nUnsteady flow oscillations, commonly known as combustion instabilities, were discovered in rocket and air-breathing engines in the late 1930s. Since then, combustion instabilities have plagued most, or practically all, engine development programs. Indeed, because of the high density of energy release in a volume having relatively low losses, conditions favor excitation and sustenance of flow oscillations in any combustion chamber intended for use in a propulsion system. \nThis seminar will provide an overview of combustion instabilities in four different types of propulsion systems (solid rocket, liquid rocket, gas turbine, and ramjet/scramjet engines). Emphasis will be placed on the present understanding of the processes involved, and contemporary research needs and challenges. Various research issues in acoustics, fluid mechanics, and chemistry related to oscillatory combustion in practical systems will be discussed. Both passive and active control techniques will be covered. Applications of contemporary numerical schemes, approximate analytical methods, and experimental diagnostic tools to combustion instability studies will be addressed.\nSpeaker\nProf. Vigor Yang is presently Ralph N. Read Chair and Regents’ Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He has published extensively in aerospace propulsion, combustion, and data science.

  "text": "Abstract\nThe two-way interaction between the flame and acoustic waves leads to thermoacoustic instabilities within combustors. To understand and quantify the flame response to oncoming acoustic waves, flame transfer functions (FTFs) or flame describing functions (FDFs) have been widely used. The G-equation low order model has been proved as a power tool to reconstruct FTFs or FDFs. This talk will firstly present the application of this low order model to the determination of the nonlinear flame dynamic response of turbulent premixed flames subjected to transverse and longitudinal acoustic disturbances. A Two-way Nonlinear Unforced Flame Speed Modeling approach was proposed. The turbulent effects were accounted for in the flame propagation speed term and the steady flame term in the kinematic equation of the flame front; an expansion method was then used to obtain the FDF. Then, the G-equation model method is applied to obtain the dynamic responses of conical and V-shape flames to dual-frequency inputs. The contributions of the two-frequency inputs and their couplings to the nonlinear flame response are identified. \nSpeaker\nProf. Jingxuan Li is currently a Professor at the School of Astronautics, Beihang University, China. He is also the Deputy Secretary-General of Beijing Thermophysics and Energy Engineering Society. In 2012, he received his PhD degree from Ecole Centrale de Paris, France.

  "text": "Abstract\nWith limited neural and sensory resources, flying insects demonstrate a remarkable ability to perform landing and navigate in obstacle-dense environments. Optical flow has been identified as the primary visual cue that governs the success of insect flight. Leveraging optical flow-based guidance and control strategies, Dr Ho aims to develop efficient control and navigation solutions for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), which are constrained in terms of payload and processing capability. However, optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to distance, but not either one independently. This inherent nonlinearity of optical flow has imposed enormous challenges in the controller design. Moreover, interpreting sparse optical flow information obtained from a single camera to discern flow patterns adds further complexity. \nIn light of these challenges, this seminar will present several novel methods for MAV landing and navigation that primarily rely on optical flow. An adaptive control strategy has been developed to successfully implement the bio-inspired constant optical flow landing on MAVs, enabling both height and velocity to decay exponentially and smoothly to zero at nearly the same time. Based on the discovery of the distance-dependent closed-loop dynamics of optical flow control, an extended Kalman filter has been formulated with the knowledge of the control input and observed optical flow to estimate the distance and velocity of MAVs. This information has also been integrated into a deep learning framework for the effective navigation of MAVs in obstacle-dense environments. Attempting to go beyond optical flow approaches for tackling navigation tasks, a self-supervised learning setup has been introduced, in which optical flow cues serve as a scaffold to learn the visual appearance of obstacles in the environment, allowing the detection of obstacles by just analysing still images. All the proposed methods have been successfully demonstrated in real-world flight.\nSpeaker\nDr Hann Woei Ho received his BEng degree in Aerospace Engineering (gold medal) from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Malaysia in 2009 and MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering (cum laude/distinction), specialized in Control and Simulation from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), the Netherlands in 2012.

I have never been to Switzerland before. It was my first time to visit a European country. I have seen some tourist spots, like Zurich’s Lindenhof, Zurich’s Limmat, Luzern, and Mount Pilatus.\nZHAW has organized many events for the incoming exchange students. For example, an orientation day, campus tour, and a welcome party. At the events, I met many students from different countries, such as Korea, Thailand, and the United States. It was fun to chat with students from diverse backgrounds and cultures. They were very nice to share their life at home university and their family as well.\nDuring my study at ZHAW, I learned a lot of in-depth professional aviation knowledge, which helped improve my career prospects. The four subjects I took were practical and exciting. The teachers always interacted with the students, and the lessons were funny. Besides, my classmates were very kind as to give me a hand if I face any problems. They sometimes brought me to excellent restaurants, and I enjoyed the time with them.\nWinterthur is a town where I study in Switzerland. It is a clean, calm, and beautiful town. Looking at the scenery from my hostel’s balcony would make me smile. The pace in Winterthur is very relaxing and slow. Therefore, I enjoy the lifestyle in my town.\nThe exchange semester is a memorable experience in my life so far. Traveling around Switzerland, I found that Switzerland has many beautiful views and buildings. You can broaden your horizons while traveling. It will give you an unforgettable experience in your university life. Thank you very much for giving me such a great opportunity to enjoy this study abroad period.\nI am looking forward to visiting Switzerland in the coming year again.\"",

The University of Surrey is at Guildford, a very gorgeous and peaceful town near London.\nThe University of Surrey has a relatively long history about its aerospace engineering. With the long-time development and good relationship with the Rolls Royce (the company with advanced technics about the turbine engine), a cooperate research centre is located in the University.\nWhat inspired me a lot is the high requirement and challenging assignment I met at the University of Surrey. In the engineering orientation, the program leader said that engineering students should always aim for perfection, which guarantees 100% safety and high quality of your product. I agreed with it entirely and will try my best to meet the requirement. \nAdditionally, my favorite professor in the exchanging semester insists that we should fully understand the basic formula in our field as an engineer. Thus, the exam is without a formula sheet and more emphasizes comprehension. I have gratitude for the professor’s high standards and help, even though the learning process is much more challenging.\nLife in a very typical British town is much different from that in Hong Kong. The living pace is relatively slow there, forcing you to truly immerse yourself in every minute of your life and challenge the time management skills. In Hong Kong, I am a person who never cooks in the hall. However, at the University of Surrey, I need to take care of myself and consider cooking dishes as most students do.\nI got the accommodation of a single room with nine flatmates from eight countries. Most of us are coming to exchange from different universities worldwide, which makes the similarities and differences. The cultural variety always attracts me a lot. It is lucky for me to meet those who are willing to share and take care of each other. The time we spent together was memorable. \nIn conclusion, the exchange is a life-long beneficial experience for me.\"",

These four months of exchange have taught me how to adapt to and embrace the various living environment. It is also an effective rehearsal for me if I plan to study or work in North America in the future. \nDuring the McGill University study (McGill), I spent a very tough period getting used to the course content and making up the knowledge gap. Since I registered a graduate-level course and it was desperate at the beginning, I kept pushing myself, and it turned out that all the efforts were worth it! Meanwhile, it is always great to meet friends from the class, and they are surprisingly nice and enthusiastic. They helped me a lot to get myself involved in McGill’s studying life. We are still keeping in touch with each other after I return home. \nSome of my friends are year 4 or graduate students. They shared with me their working experience in Canada and recommended some excellent companies in North America. I learned some potential career directions, which helped me to make a reasonable decision in the future. \nIn this exchange, I had a chance to explore a different society, life pace and routine. I became more extroverted and familiarized with their communication habits and wordings. Since I lived in Montreal, a French zone in Canada, I could taste both European and North American culture. I went to several church ceremonies, which were divine and impressive. Meanwhile, the music festival show was marvelous and intriguing, which gave me a significant relaxation. Most excitingly, I watched many sports matches that I might not see in Asia, such as ice hockey, American football and NBA.\nThis experience journey is unexpectedly fruitful and enjoyable.

The final year courses I took were complicated and challenging, as there was a vast knowledge gap. I did not relax and undisciplined as an overseas exchange student, yet I worked very hard in all courses. I attended all the lectures/online classes throughout the entire learning experience and made an effort to revise the learning materials independently. I gained valuable personal growth in many ways.

Consequently, this exchange became a big challenge for me. I had to solve problems independently and took care of myself. When I went to Brisbane, I successfully managed to take a flight and located the accommodation independently. I also learned how to cook.\nAt the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), I registered a few courses to study. It was a very tough period because I needed to spend extra time to learn and make up for the knowledge gaps. However, after my perseverance and attempts, I received excellent grades.\nI have dreamed of becoming a commercial airline pilot since Secondary 5. Therefore, I took a 3-week flight training in Australia, which is globally famous for pilot training. After the intensive training in the super-hot weather, I successfully completed solo (flying a circuit around the aerodrome without flight instructors) 5 times! In this experience, I am more affirmative that being a pilot is my dream. Besides, the flight instructors and students also shared how to be an airline pilot in their countries. I have a clearer picture of my goal and know more about the career path.\nAfter living in Australia for a few weeks, I found that people in Australia really focus on environmental greening and work-life balance. In Brisbane city, there are two large parks, a huge human-made beach and an observation wheel. People love going to the parks during lunch breaks for relaxation or having a night walk after dinner.

  "text": "Landing safety has long been a concern in commercial airlines. In a landing system, a team with heterogeneous operators, including pilots and air traffic controllers (ATCOs), is required to collaboratively accomplish safe landing. However, owing to time pressure, limited airspace in the terminal area, and inevitable goal differences between parties, interaction conflicts have been identified as one of the critical issues in landing safety. From the view of organizational ergonomics, interaction conflicts are mostly derived from the gaps of mental model between parties, known as mental model disconnects. Accordingly, a series of research was conducted to approach how underlying mental model disconnects jeopardize landing safety. Furthermore, the corresponding solutions were proposed to mitigate the negative effects of mental model disconnects for better landing safety.\nDr Hsueh-Yi Lai received his BSc and MSc degrees at National Chen Kung University, Taiwan, respectively in 2012 and 2015.

The problem is formulated in a two-stage optimisation framework and the proposed methods further enhance the quality of Pareto-optimality Benders-dual cutting plane based on core point approximation in the second stage optimisation problem. In addition, the model could determine the estimated average delay time at runways with different settings of additional buffer for longitudinal separation requirement and trade-off parameters between the estimated average delay time at runways and estimated penalty cost of cruise speed adjustment.

The airlines play an important role in improving their service level and mitigating the profit risks incurred due to their poor resources planning. However, identifying and mitigating operational risks faced by the airlines is complicated, as they are coming from both internal and external factors. Due to the realistic nature, we explore the flying time characteristics, and further model the consecutive interdependent departure-arrival times. It is a key feature included in this study that has not been studied in literature. The research characterizes the flying time of each flight by the heteroscedastic regression model. The analytical closed-form for the recursive relationship of the expected departure and arrival times of connective flight legs is then carried out. Accordingly, a novel data-driven bi-criteria mathematical model is proposed in which the interdependent structures of the departure and arrival times of the consecutive flights is incorporated into the robust optimization. A column generation-based algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. The real-data based computational examples identify that our proposed model sufficiently improves the reliability of the crew pairings decisions by reducing the total deviated time from the schedules with a slight increase of the total basic crew operations cost.

  "text": "This research is motivated by the increasing maintenance demand in the aviation sector and the transition of Maintenances, Repairs, and Operations (MRO) practices adopted by airline companies.\nWith the expansion of the airlines’ fleet, airline companies begin to adjust their MRO practices, to pursue a trade-off between operating costs, mandatory MRO regulations, and profitability. Outsourcing an airline’s partial MRO to an independent MRO service company becomes a promising option, from an airline’s perspective. Therefore, MRO service companies play an important role in performing series MRO maintenance checks for aircrafts from different airlines and guaranteeing their continuous safety and reliability. However, the internal maintenance resource organization, planning, and external service scheduling are complicated. The transition of MRO practices, therefore, creates a great challenge for MRO service companies. \nAccordingly, this research explores MRO maintenance services’ characteristics from the MRO service companies’ perspective. In view of the realistic nature of this problem, several characteristics are studied. Aircraft maintenance hangar capacity is one of the primal features, which has a significant impact on MRO service companies’ service capability. Aircrafts’ physical non-convex shape in two-dimensional space is investigated and modelled in the hangar parking capacity optimization section, which has not been addressed in literature. Based on geometrical modelling, a multi-period hangar parking layout planning section is carried out, incorporating several practical aircraft movement considerations. Afterward, a multi-skill staffing section is further extended, which fulfils the primal maintenance resources in MRO service planning. Accordingly, several mathematical models are proposed, followed by the respective optimization approaches. \nThe real-data-based problem instances are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, in view of the MRO service company’s service level enhancement, resource utilization improvement, and resource bottleneck identifications. Meanwhile, several managerial implications regarding maintenance resources level improvements are discussed as well.\nThe research seminar is supported by the Mainland-Hong Kong University Alliances Activity 2021 – 2022, Shanghai-Hong Kong University Alliance (SHUA), Mainland-Hong Kong University Alliances Activity, University Grants Committee, HKSAR, China. \nDr Jason Y.

We look forward to welcoming candidates who will be starting the new cadet courses and becoming part of the Cathay Pacific team upon graduation. As we get ready to meet the rising global demand for travel, we have already started a comprehensive plan to hire 4,000 front-line employees to meet our operational needs over the next 18-24 months. This includes over 700 pilots, of which 400 are cadet graduates joining as Second Officers by the end of 2023. Overall, we aim to train more than 1,000 cadet pilots by 2025.”\nPolyU Deputy President and Provost Prof. Wing-tak WONG said: “The civil aviation industry has been the backbone of Hong Kong's development. PolyU and Boeing co-founded the first Aviation Services Research Centre (ASRC) in Hong Kong ten years ago and the centre has since become a successful exemplar of research and innovation collaboration between academia and industry. The University later established the Department of Aeronautical and Civil Aviation Engineering to provide undergraduate, master and doctoral degree programmes to nurture talents in the industry and strengthen scientific research in the field of civil aviation and aeronautical engineering.”\nProf. Wong continues: “Moving forward, we will continue to actively collaborate with industry partners to develop more professional qualifications and training programmes in support of the National 14th Five-Year Plan, so as to contribute to the healthy and sustainable development of the civil aviation industry in Hong Kong and the Nation.”\nThe new 55-60 week integrated course comprises three stages: theory, simulator training and flight training. Under the newly signed agreement, PolyU will provide a 150-working-day Theoretical Ground Training course that includes a minimum of 750 hours of instruction and examination in areas including principles of flight, meteorology, human performance, general navigation, instrumentation, radio navigation, air law and more. Successful candidates will then commence flight training overseas before returning to Cathay City for multi-crew simulator training.\nThe first batch of 24 candidates have already started the integrated course at PolyU in March and are scheduled to commence flight training in October after they have completed the ground theory portion of the programme. In parallel with the new integrated course, Cathay Pacific is also conducting cadet pilot training courses based upon the original programme module in Adelaide.\nConducting the majority of cadet-training activities in Hong Kong will ensure that the training regime is specifically suited to meet the needs of Cathay Pacific. Cadet pilots will be familiarised with aviation facilities and relevant organisations in Hong Kong, such as the CAD, Hong Kong Air Traffic Control, the Hong Kong Airport Fire Contingent, Cathay Pacific maintenance providers such as HAECO, and specifically the expertise of PolyU and the Cathay Pacific Training Centre.\nEnrolment for the Cathay Pacific Cadet Pilot programme is open, and we greatly encourage aspiring pilots to visit the following link for information on the application criteria and the benefits of a rewarding career: https://careers.cathaypacific.com/jobs/cadet-pilot-program-5519030\n[From PolyU Media Release]\nRead more on South China Morning Post: https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3191455/cathay-pacific-seeks-hire-400-cadet-pilots-end.",

High-speed flow researches:\nStudies on the fascinating high-speed flow promote the development of super- to hyper-sonic vehicles, such as Supersonic Combustion Ramjet (SCRamjet), aerospace shuttle, as well as various hypersonic vehicles. The research team led by Prof. Chih-Yung Wen at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the university focuses on a few key elements in this field: 1) the interaction of the detached shock with rain droplet during the reentry of a space shuttle; 2) controlling of boundary layer transition during hypersonic flight; 3) non-equilibrium flow in and out of a hypersonic vehicle where the real-gas effect has to be considered; and 4) interpreting the mechanism of detonation and pursuing its accurate simulation.\nBoth numerical and experimental platforms have been built and researches are proceeding based on them. The in-house CFD method has shown good performance in capturing shock waves and contact discontinuities in simulating compressible single- and multi-fluid problems and the method itself is under further development. Shock tube with shadowgraph visualization system has produced reliable shock/droplet interaction images which not only validated the numerical simulations but also facilitated other high-speed flow research. A boundary layer transition control strategy is conducted numerically on a Mach 6 flat-plate using heating or cooling strip, where an efficient way to stabilize the hypersonic boundary layer is obtained. Considering the vibrational nonequilibrium effect, a modified steady one-dimensional Zel’dövich-von Neumann-Doring detonation model has been proposed, which confirms its important role played in the detonation cell size change. Via extensive numerical simulation on detonation, the vibrational relaxation in the chemical reaction has also been testified to be a crucial mechanism.\nFig.1 Shock tube facility and high-speed Schlieren image system for shock/droplet interaction research.\nFig.2 Ludwieg tube facility with SQRT(unit Re = 1.4~3.2 x 10^7 m^(-1)), Ma=4.0 and test time of 40 ms.\nFig.3 Numerical soot foils using four different vibrational energy/chemical reaction coupling models.\n2. Applications of Plasma Actuators:\nPlasma actuators have attracted considerable attention in the aerospace industry due to their features of simple mechanism, easy maintenance, low cost and fast response, and they can be formed to various shapes of vehicles. The plasma actuator ionizes the gas molecules and forms the plasma. Electric field induces the motion of plasma and results in the ionic wind which alters the velocity profile inside the boundary layer through the particle collisions and finally changes the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle. The research team experimentally investigated the effects of Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuators on the aerodynamics of a slender delta wing. The leading edge vortex breakdown locations under both symmetric and asymmetric control forms and various control frequencies are summarized. The aerodynamic response to the controls suggests that the DBD plasma actuator is a promising technique for delta wing maneuvering. More investigations on the delta wing maneuvering will be conducted in the near future.\nFig. 4. Smoke flow visualization results show the typical LEV structure in the transverse cross-section: (a) baseline case; (b) symmetric control case; and (c) asymmetric control (starboard-controlled) case. (α = 36°; Re = 50 000).\n3. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)\nWilderness search and rescue entails performing a wide-range of work in complex environments and large regions. Given the concerns inherent in large regions due to limited rescue distribution, UAV-based frameworks are a promising platform for providing aerial imaging. The research team led by Prof. Chih-Yung Wen developed an all-in-one camera-based target detection and positioning system and integrated it into a fully autonomous UAV. It is capable of on-board, real-time target identification, post-target identification and location and aerial image collection for further mapping applications. A UAV communication relay solution was also developed by the research team to extend the communication range and bypass obstacles in complex environments. In the application of tail-sitter vertical take-off and landing (TVOL) UAV, a hardware-in-loop simulation environment is established which is capable of real-time dynamic simulation and supports a robot operating system (ROS)-based open-source autopilot. An independent ROS package is well prepared for data communication between a simulator and flight control computer. 2016 Taiwan UAV competition champion is awarded to Prof. Wen’s team. In the MAV field, autonomous control is well realized on a four-wing flapping MAV by which the clap and fling mechanism was proven to play a key role in the lift generation. The understanding of MAV structure and aerodynamics has promoted the designing of flapping MAVs.\nFig.5 Photos of a fixed-wing UAV and a tail-sitter VTOL\nSelected Publications (2012-present, Since joining HKPolyU)",

  "text": "Unmanned autonomous systems (UAS), such as unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), are one of the key “ingredients” for the arrival of smart cities. We have witnessed great advancement of the UAS in the past decades. For example, the demonstration of the UGV in constrained areas was available, which has the potential to alleviate the problems of traffic congestion and accidents. The UAV for autonomous parcel delivery can further unlock the 3D space for the betterment of human beings. However, we rarely see the massive deployment of UAS in complex urban environments, because of the limitation of existing UAS technology. For example, perception (positioning and mapping, etc) and control are significantly challenged in urban scenarios, leading to unacceptable uncertainty in UAS. Trustworthiness, which is of great importance to the UAS, is hard to guarantee due to the complex environmental conditions. In fact, the development of UAS technology is getting into the “long-tail period” which is an internationally recognized challenge towards the massive deployment of the UAS in our daily life. This talk will present some recent research findings on the advocacy of the trustworthiness of the UAS perception and control, which include: (1) the outlieraware LiDAR-centered multi-sensory integration-based high-accuracy mapping for UGV in complex urban areas; (2) visual localization within the prior light-weight map for UAV; (3) the positioning-control joint optimization model for the resilient UAV, which exploits the complementariness of the flight dynamics and the positioning state estimation; (4) safety certification for the visual/LiDAR localization of UAV/UGV; (5) vision aided RTK positioning for UAV parcel delivery in complex urban canyons; (6) UAV-aided additive manufacturing without spatial limitation; and (7) intelligent roadside infrastructure and UGV collaboration for high definition map update for UGV. Many of the codebases have been open-sourced for the benefit of the research community or knowledge transferred for industry collaboration for far-reaching and impactful outcomes.\nDr Weisong Wen received a PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) in 2020 and was also a visiting PhD student at the Faculty of Engineering, University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in 2018. Having served as a Postdoc Researcher at the PolyU for a short period, Dr Wen is now serving as a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering of PolyU. His research interests focus on trustworthy spatial perception (positioning, mapping, etc) and control (ground vehicle control and aerial vehicle control, etc) for unmanned autonomous systems (UAS), such as the unnamed ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Dr Wen has published more than 30 SCI journal papers and 32 international conference papers (Google Citations: 907, h-index:18 by 1st June 2023), within the field of UAS and intelligent transportation systems. He has served as the branch/field chairman of IEEE ITSC 2022/2023, the top conference in the field of intelligent transportation, ICGNC 2022, and ION GNSS+ 2022/2023, the annual meeting of the American Navigation Association. He regularly organized workshops in IEEE ITSC 2022/2023 on the topic of trustworthy UAS (UAV, UGV, etc) in complex urban canyons by collaborating with researchers from MIT, RWTH Aachen University, HKUST, University of Macau, Technische Universität Chemnitz, German Aerospace Center (DLR), and Tsinghua University, etc. Meanwhile, He served as the Young Editor Board Member and Leading Guest Editor of several journals. He lead the open-sourced UrbanLoco dataset together with the Mechanical Systems Control (MSC) lab (led by Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka) at UC Berkeley in 2020. He also open-sourced the UrbanNav dataset and the GraphGNSSLib library for reliable positioning in urban canyons. His research on high-precision LiDAR-based mapping algorithms for UGV in urban environments won the ION GNSS+ 2020 Best Presentation Award, TechConnect World Innovation Conference, and Expo Innovation Award 2021, and was recently patented in the U.S. He also won the First Prize in Hong Kong Section in Qianhai-Guangdong-Macao Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, 2019. His research in vision-aided UAV RTK positioning received a research award from Meituan UAV with the potential for autonomous parcel delivery. In addition, his recent research on UAV-aided additive manufacturing recently received funding support from the PolyU Research Institute for Advanced Manufacturing (RIAM). His research work was recognized internationally which led to the regular explicit PhD student exchange from international institutions, such as The Technische Universität Chemnitz in Germany, Leibniz University Hannover in Germany, and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology in Japan to Dr Wen’s research group. Dr Wen’s research received multiple research funding from both academics and industry fields, such as Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission (ITF), PolyU, Huawei Technologies, Meituan UAV, and Tencent, leading to more than 7.5 million HKD in research funds as PI since 2021.",

This seminar presents a series of techniques for robot inspection tasks and then introduces three applications within this context. First, for quadrotors, we introduce a reinforcement learning motion planner designed for aggressive narrow gap traversing. The planned motion was successfully demonstrated on a real quadrotor. Second, the seminar presents planners for autonomous exploration, aiming to maximize information collection within unknown scenarios. This algorithm is extended to explore contact-rich scenes, enabling robots to navigate within cluttered environments. Third, the seminar introduces teleoperation that involves human control in the loop. The integration of virtual reality and haptic feedback enables bidirectional teleoperation that enhances the operator’s situational awareness. Lastly, the seminar discusses the prospective applications of these technologies to flight control applications, highlighting the potential for accomplishing complex flight tasks that were previously unattainable.\nDr Chenxi Xiao earned his PhD degree from the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University (Purdue), advised by Prof. Juan Wachs. His doctoral research focused on enabling robots to comprehend the environments when visual sensing is limited or unavailable. Before joining Purdue, he worked on reinforcement learning for flight control at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, developed various embedded control systems at China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, and obtained his BS and MS degrees from the School of Automation at Northwestern Polytechnical University. Dr Xiao's research interests encompass robot motion planning and control, teleoperation, deep learning, and electronics.",

The project was a sub-project within the AAE Final Year Project “Trajectory prediction and planning, and assistance control: Towards the Predictive Advanced Driver-Assistance System (P-ADAS)” under the supervision of Dr Hailong Huang.\nAI x HK OpenCup 2022 was organized by Hong Kong Baptist University in collaboration with the Hong Kong Society of Artificial Intelligence (HKSAIR) and sponsored by Nvidia, Microsoft, Huawei, ASTRI, etc. It invites students in Hong Kong to address real-world problems with AI technologies focused on four Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations (UN). Participants are expected to ideate innovative AI solutions for addressing challenges in the Hong Kong context, to make a positive social impact and promote sustainability. Among 152 teams, our AAE student’s project AICAS stood Top 2 with a cash award of HK$20,000.\nAICAS was proposed to tackle the safety issue of risky highway driving in complex lane-changing scenarios. In real-time, it constantly forecasts the complicated future motion of neighbouring vehicles via transformer-based neural networks. It also predicts the driver's intention through a cabin camera via KLT face-tracking and graph-based convolutional neural networks, and compares the intention with the future motion of neighbouring participants to assess risk in real-time via Gauss-Markov process modelling. In a potentially dangerous scenario, it takes over driver controls and executes the maneuver with the lowest risk, thus preventing deadly accidents, saving lives, and providing a massive impact on UN SDG 11.\nThe Department is proud of Mr Hasan’s outstanding performance.

No study to date has investigated the effects of conflict geometry on human factors variables of ATCOs through objective and physiological approaches. This study examines the effects of conflict geometries on ATCO situation awareness, stress level and brain activity during conflict resolution. Fifteen participants were instructed to resolve six different conflict geometries: crossing level, crossing non-level, converging level, converging non-level, overtaking level, and overtaking non-level. The results indicate that converging and crossing conflicts led to lower situation awareness (SA), higher stress level, and higher theta activation at the temporal and parietal lobes. Level conflict led to lower SA. The findings offer two implications, providing insights for the formal guidelines in ATC conflict resolution training and provision of inputs for the conflict resolution aid development.\nProf. Chun-Hsien CHEN is Professor, Director of the Design Stream, and Professor-in-Charge of the Design & Human Factors Lab in the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

  "text": "Electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) vehicles enable Urban Aerial Mobility (UAM). This paper optimizes the number, locations and capacities of vertiports in UAM systems, while capturing interdependencies between strategic vertiport deployment, tactical operations and passenger demand. The model includes a “tractable part” (based on mixed-integer second-order conic optimization) but also a non-convex demand function We develop an exact algorithm that approximates non-convex functions with piece-wise constant segments, iterating between a conservative model (which yields a feasible solution) and a relaxed model (which yields a solution guarantee). We propose an adaptive discretization scheme that converges to a global optimum—thanks to the relaxed model. Our algorithm converges to a 1% optimality gap, dominating static discretization benchmarks in terms of solution quality, runtimes and solution guarantee. We find that the most attractive structure for UAM is one that uses a few high-capacity vertiports, consolidating operations primarily to serve long-distance trips. Moreover, UAM profitability is highly sensitive to network planning optimization and to customer expectations, perhaps even more so than to vehicle specifications. Therefore, the success of UAM operations requires not only mature eVTOL technologies, but also tailored analytics-based capabilities to optimize strategic planning and market-based efforts to drive customer demand.\nDr Kai WANG is currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Vehicle and Mobility at Tsinghua University.

  "text": "With dramatically increasing traffic demand, the air transportation system not only has been expanding in scale, but also welcoming new entrants including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). With potentially large demand for UAV delivery in the foreseeable future, the need for and importance of efficiently managing UAV traffic in urban airspace is arising. We first addressed high density UAV delivery operations in low-altitude urban airspace. We proposed a framework of Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) including UAV path planning, Traffic Management models with conflict detection and resolution (CD&R), and mechanism design for airspace resource allocation. We found that strategic UTM can enable a sizable share of UAV deliveries with relatively low congestion costs. Then we explored the potential benefit of operating multiple delivery modes synergistically integrating traditional trucks, electric cargo bikes and UAVs. Multi-modal systems are increasingly perceived as the future solution to help reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, noise, and safety concerns. We optimized several different multi-modal strategies in a manner that considers the impact of truck traffic on urban congestion. This work will eventually determine whether and under what conditions UAV delivery can mitigate road congestion in a cost-effective manner. Also in traditional commercial aviation, multi-modal systems integrating air with ground transportation to enable flight diversion can be one of the solutions to improve the efficiency of Air Traffic Management (ATM). \nSupervised by Prof. Mark Hansen, Ms Ang Li is a PhD candidate in the Transportation Engineering Programme, Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at University of California Berkeley.

  "text": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are classic research problems in computer vision. Many real applications further require dense SLAM with a monocular camera, i.e. recovering the depth of each pixel of a single moving camera. Solving this problem is crucial for obstacle avoidance in robotics and scene understanding in AR/VR. This talk presents our recent progresses on this challenging problem with deep neural networks. We first review the classic structure-from-motion (SfM) formulation to design a differentiable Gauss-Newton algorithm, which enables an end-to-end deep neural network to solve both camera pose and dense scene depth from input images. The network further learns shape priors in terms of linear subspaces to facilitate depth estimation at textureless regions. With this end-to-end formulation, we then introduce a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to enhance the iterative optimization by predicting a solution updater according to the feature space landscape of an intermediate solution. The GRU optimizer achieves better accuracy and efficiency than many previous optimization methods. In the next, we employ a neural implicit function with a differentiable renderer to encode the scene, which enforces strong shape priors can even predict maps of unobserved regions. This novel scene representation leads to promising results and outperforms several strong baselines of RGB and RGB-D SLAM.\nDr Ping Tan will join the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as a Professor.

Firstly, for incompressible wall turbulence, we develop a new methodology to assess the streamwise inclination angles (SIAs) of the wall-attached eddies populating the logarithmic region with a given wall-normal height. The present results show, for the first time, that the SIAs of attached eddies are Reynolds-number dependent in low and medium Reynolds numbers and tend to saturate at 45o as the Reynolds number increases. These findings clarify the long-term debate and perfect the picture of the attached-eddy model. Secondly, we will present our recent efforts in modelling the compressible wall-bounded turbulence. The extension of incompressible wall model to high-speed flows is accommodated by proposing a novel transformation, which maps the mean velocity profiles of compressible wall turbulence to the incompressible law of the wall. The performance of the transformation is verified for compressible wall-bounded flows with edge Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 15 and friction Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 2000. (Ref.

  "text": "Buoyancy-driven flows are common in nature and industry. This study focuses on the basic equations and control strategies of buoyancy-driven flows. For low-Mach-number cases, several buoyancy terms have been introduced to simplify the basic equations in the past 120 years, but their validities and accuracies are not clarified. The first part of the present study derived a formal perturbation solution of the hydrodynamic pressure in low-Mach-number flows. Based on the solution, some previous buoyancy terms are proved to be invalid. Instead, new buoyancy terms with arbitrarily high accuracies are introduced. The second part of the present work proposed a control strategy for horizontally confined Rayleigh-Bénard convection. Very small isothermal areas are added to adiabatic vertical sidewalls and will behave like trip wires which can trigger boundary layer separation. This control strategy can regulate the sizes of large-scale vortices and enhance heat transport.\nDr Shengqi Zhang is an Assistant Professor at the Eastern Institute of Advanced Study, China. He received his BSc and PhD degrees from Peking University. His research interests include turbulence, heat & mass transfer, multiphase flows, and AI-empowered computing. In the past 4 years, he has published 5 articles in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics as the First Author and received the Honours of Outstanding PhD Thesis and Outstanding Graduate of Peking University.",
