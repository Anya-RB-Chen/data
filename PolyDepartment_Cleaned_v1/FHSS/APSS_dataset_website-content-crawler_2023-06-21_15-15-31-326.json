The establishment of the QEF is one of the major recommendations of the Education Commission Report No.7 (ECR7). Formally established on 2 January 1998 with an allocation of $5 billion, the QEF provides an effective channel for worthwhile projects from the school education sector to be funded.\n2\nUniversity Grants Committee–Teaching Development Grant 2019-22\nLarger-scale Collaborative Projects \nThe University Grants Committee (UGC) introduced the Teaching Development Grants (TDG) in 1994-95 to provide funding support to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in local institutions: new initiatives that involve collaboration among faculties/departments/programmes to enhance learning and teaching across multiple programmes and/or subject disciplines.\nUniversity Grants Committee–Teaching Development Grant 2019-22\nSmaller-scale Projects \t\nThe University Grants Committee (UGC) introduced the Teaching Development Grants (TDG) in 1994-95 to provide funding support to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in local institutions: new initiatives by individual teachers or subject/programme teams to develop and implement innovative approaches to learning and teaching on a more localised scale.\n4\nStrategic Plan Initiatives to Enhance the Student Learning Experience through the Use of Interactive Pedagogies\nIn PolyU’s current Strategic Plan Shaping the Future for 2019/20-2024/25, eLearning development features prominently. The overarching goal for learning and teaching highlights the University’s commitment to enhance learning experience via a refined curriculum that features an effective blend of face-to-face and online modes of learning and appropriate application of interactive pedagogies and education technologies. Enhancing the student learning experience through the use of interactive pedagogies has an important place in this plan.\n5\nUniversity Grants Committee–Strategic Development of Virtual Teaching and Learning\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, online teaching has been widely adopted and has become the prevalent mode of teaching and learning as the universities suspended face-to-face classes most of the time. Both the UGC and the QAC believe that, after the pandemic, universities will continue to make use of VTL to enhance the overall effectiveness and experience of teaching and learning. The UGC introduced this special grant in late January 2021 to support “the strategic move towards more intensive and systematic adoption of VTL”. \n6\nDepartmental Learning and Teaching Grant\nThe DLTG is established with a view to \nenhancing the quality and performance of our faculty members in a wide range of learning and teaching activities defined under the University’s ‘teaching domain’ for the benefit of student learning and staff career development.\nencouraging faculty members to engage in exchange and collaboration in learning and teaching activities.\nproviding faculty members with opportunities to explore and develop diverse and innovative learning and teaching ideas and methodologies for applying external grants in the next stage.\n7\nGrant for Online Teaching Development and Educational Research\nThis is a Quality Incentive Scheme established with funding support up to $50 million for academic departments, teaching centers, independent schools, and relevant non-academic units with a view to enhancing online teaching and motivating departments to make continuous improvement.\n",

I have become more resilient and open-minded to new ideas. The adoption of new insights and the slight changes in attitude are certainly the most invaluable treasures I gained during the exchange.\nWoolly Ko to Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences, Finland\nBeing an exchange student is one of the best things in my life. I made a lot of good friends. I got more familiar with the different cultures of my new friends, which significantly broadened my horizons. I also learnt another political ideology in Finland, which enhanced my global outlook. Last but not least, I also went to the Arctic Circle with my classmates and saw the most beautiful natural scenery on Earth.\nFinland is a very beautiful and peaceful country. Its nature is well-preserved and always within reach. My friends and I liked exploring forests and lakes by bike. Some of my friends were even brave enough to jump into a lake of just a few degrees Celsius! It was really interesting to interact with foreigners and learn about the hidden customs of their homeland. I experienced a great culture shock! \nWan Pui Yin to Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences, Finland\nMy Europe exchange experience, which was the best experience ever, always flashes through my mind. It is not only about studying but more exploration and adventures. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for any undergraduate here at APSS. \nCheng Cheung to University of Twente, the Netherlands\nThis UBC exchange program was a very precious and dream-fulfilling experience. Not only did it provide me with the opportunity to experience student life at this world-famous university, but it also broadened my horizons through the exchange of views on social work and social policies with people and agencies in Vancouver. \nCynthia Ko to the University of British Columbia, Canada\nServices provided in Vancouver are also available in Hong Kong. However, I still feel something is missing in Hong Kong, something that makes immigrants see Hong Kong as their home. We should strive for it and make Hong Kong a better place for every person. \nDonna Yue to the University of British Columbia, Canada\nIf you study abroad, you will meet people across the globe and make friends that you never expected. They might come from the countries in war or places that you never knew existed on the map. What’s more is how they inspire your thinking. They may offer you a brand new way of thinking and opinions. \nEric Lo to Malmö University, Sweden\nGoing on an exchange had been my dream since I was still a secondary school student. Finally, I have accomplished it. \nChau-kwan Cheung to Linkoping University, Sweden\nNot only was I able to experience a new living style in a new environment, but I was also able to meet and make friends with great people and had chance to integrate myself into a foreign country. This experience is an unforgettable memory for me and will always remind me to be strong and tough and enjoy and cherish my life no matter where I am. \nLiang Shang to Seoul National University, South Korea\nThe Summer Placement with the PolyU Department of Applied Social Sciences (APSS) was a life-changing, practical, cultural, and communal learning experience. \nBrian Cheung from University of California, Berkeley, USA\nI gained exposure to the experiences of people who identified as ethnic minorities in Hong Kong and witnessed how social services engaged hard-to-reach populations to provide services and address needs. Overall, it was an enriching, educational, and unique experience. \nVictoria Crucena from University of California, Berkeley, USA\nThe mission of the Faculty of Engineering is to educate the technological and engineering leaders of tomorrow.\nAnh Kieu from University of California, San Diego, USA\nComing to Hong Kong and the PolyU was the best decision I’ve ever made! I’ve spent an inexpressible time at PolyU and thinking of it makes me smile every time!

Year 3 Social Policy and Social Entrepreneurship (SPSE) Students Shine\nAPSS is proud to announce that a team of APSS Year 3 students, including Brandon Chiu Yeung CHAN, Wellesley Chun Yui LEUNG, and James Tsz For LO, from the BA (Hons) in Social Policy and Social Entrepreneurship (SPSE) programme won the Stage One award (HKD 20,000) of the PolyU Micro Fund 2022-23 Cohort 1. The team has subsequently been admitted to the HKSTP Ideation Programme (HKD 100,000).\nWith support and professional advice from Dr Raymond TAM, Programme Leader of BA (Hons) in SPSE, and Mr Ken CHAU, Project Associate of BA (Hons) in SPSE and also an alumnus of APSS, the team showed remarkable skill in the competition. Their effort in all rounds of assessment ultimately put them ahead of more than 100 teams to win the award.\nTwo APSS students awarded the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship\nMs Kan Shuen CHIU, BA (Hons) in Social Work, and Ms Wanzi SONG, BA (Hons) in Social Policy & Social Entrepreneurship, were awarded the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship (GRI). Organised by Mitacs, the GRI is established for undergraduate students to take up a 12-week research internship from May to August 2023 under the supervision of faculty members from Canadian universities.\nEach nominated student should select one discipline-related project. Ms CHIU chose to work on a project entitled “Passive victims but empowered actors: Building an older-adult-specific training module in disaster settings” at Dalhousie University. Ms SONG would be doing her research internship at McGill University, as she chose to work on a project entitled “From Vulnerability to Resilience: Highly Skilled African Immigrants' Experiences in the Quebec Labour Market”.\nMs Kan Shuen CHIU said, “It is an honor for me to be selected as one of the interns in the program. The project I have chosen is related to the concept of empowerment and the aging issue worldwide. I am always interested in these two topics and I would like to dig further into the topics and issues. The internship is a great opportunity for me to understand more about the issues and how social services are conducted in Canada, as I can personally travel and explore around the nation. Through the overseas internship, I hope to broaden my horizons, learn more about social work approaches, and gain a better understanding about the welfare policies adopted in Canada.” \nMs Wanzi SONG said, “When I first read the project’s title, From Vulnerability to Resilience: Highly Skilled African Immigrants' Experiences in the Quebec Labor Market, a number of questions arose about what challenges the immigrants might encounter despite being high-skilled, to what extent the difficulties will affect their integration into the labor market, and so on. To dig deeper into these issues, I decided to apply for this project. Since interviews will be used in this project to collect data, I really expect to have an opportunity to communicate with African immigrants face-to-face or online. I also hope to explore the city of Montreal as much as possible in my spare time.”\nCongratulations to Kan Shuen and Wanzi! APSS will continue to support students to gain a global vision and enrich their learning experiences throughout their studies.\nAPSS Newsletter on Student Exchange and Non-Local Experience – Latest Issue!\nThe latest issue of APSS Newsletter on Student Exchange and Non-Local Experience is now available on departmental website.\nThere were some recaps such as celebration of Mid-Autumn Festival with international students and sharing from student who went to Finland for exchange and students who came to Hong Kong from Finland and UK.

  "text": "Dr Paul V. Khiatani is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Social Sciences at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Prior to July 2022, he was a postdoc at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where he also received his PhD in Sociology in February 2020. During his PhD, he was a Visiting Fellow (May – July 2018) at the Sydney Democracy Network, The University of Sydney. \nPaul’s research interests include social and political participation (such as volunteering, protests, and collective actions), youth studies and emerging adults, organized crime and street gangs, and deviant (or counter-normative) behaviors. More broadly, Paul is keen on exploring puzzles and paradoxes of human relations and selfhood that naturally emerge from our contemporary (and often absurd) arrangements of social life. Possessing a strong inclination to adopt interdisciplinary approaches, and being a proponent of methodological pluralism, he continues to embrace an inquiry-driven tradition to research. \nPaul has been involved in grant-writing and active management of funded projects since he was a PhD student. Notably, for example, he was a Co-PI for an interdisciplinary project on the marginalization of children in Hong Kong (2017 – 2018), funded by Save the Children Hong Kong. He also played a leading role in securing and successfully completing projects funded by the General Research Fund (Research Grants Council, UGC) and Public Policy Research (Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office). \nHis work has been published in various academic outlets, including, but not limited to, British Journal of Social Work, Punishment & Society, Child Indicators Research, The Social Science Journal, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, Deviant Behavior, Innovations in Education and Teaching International, and Citizenship Teaching & Learning. Oftentimes supported by a competitive funding/grant or sponsorship vis-à-vis personal invitation, he has presented his work in a variety of academic conferences around the world.\nPaul tries to be as active as possible in local and academic communities. For example, locally, he served as Executive Committee Member (and Head of Social Services) of the Sir Edward Youde Scholars Association (2020 – 2022). During his time as a PhD student, he also worked with City-Youth Empowerment Project (CYEP), CityU. At CYEP, he was involved in various research and teaching projects (with a group of really passionate staff and volunteers!), reaching out and impacting communities locally as well as internationally (e.g., in Myanmar, Indonesia, and Taiwan). In academic circles, he serves as a peer-reviewer for several journals, and acts as an award/grant reviewer for a couple of international associations. He is also a Managing Editor of Bandung: Journal of the Global South. \nInsofar as time permits, Paul is open to discussing with people (regardless of academic level and disciplinary background) about opportunities to work together on overlapping areas of interest. Whether a partnership/collaboration results from the discussion or not is beside the point; connecting ideas and people is what matters most to him.",

Dr Zhan’s research interests include infrastructure of development, urbanisation and migration, mobility and temporality, voluntarism and anthropological theory. Through the lens of development and migration, her work explores a wide range of issues, including governance, labour, social reproduction, and morality. \nDr Zhan has conducted extensive fieldwork in several Chinese cities including Beijing, Chongqing and Shenzhen, and is now extending her research to other places in and beyond China. Her articles have appeared in Urban Studies, Cities, Dialectical Anthropology, Urban Anthropology, Anthropological Forum, Positions, China Information, Pacific Affairs, among others. She also writes in Chinese and published in Chinese academic journals, such as Academic Journal of Tsinghua University and Tianjin Social Sciences. Dr Zhan is the winner of 2020 Eduard B.

Her research projects (as PI) have been supported by the Association for Asian Studies, Hong Kong Research Council, and Kaifeng Foundation. \nDr Zhan is currently working on a book manuscript tentatively titled Brutal Temporary: Venturing and the Politics of Future on Beijing’s Urban Fringes. This ethnography focuses on Chinese rural migrants who struggled to live a dignified life through venturing on the metropolitan fringe of Beijing. The book brings time and temporality to the fore to understanding the modes of social marginalisation and the politics of hope in urban China. It also complicates our understanding of China’s internal migration regime by looking beyond factories and into urban informal economies. Her other book project investigates the short-lived NGO activities in Beijing’s rural migrant communities from the early 2000s to mid-2010s. Since 2020, she has started a new project on emergent small city urbanisation transforming both urbanisation and migration dynamics and experiences in China, and she hopes this project will help us to understand China’s urban condition in the context of COVID-19 too.\nRecently, she has begun to explore the possibility of a new ethnographic project on China’s energy construction projects, particularly wind power projects, in the context of environmental degradation, fast urbanisation and governmental ambition.",

She had been a service supervisor in a multiservice non-governmental organization supervising a wide range of services including children and youth services, school counseling services, training projects for dyslexic children, family support programmes, service for the homeless people, and community development projects. \nJanet’s research interests include poverty, family process, adolescent development and wellbeing, and parent education. Her studies mainly focus on four areas: (1) family processes and adolescent development in economically disadvantaged families; (2) the phenomenon of overparenting and its impacts to parent and adolescent wellbeing; (3) family resilience in families facing adversities; and (4) program evaluation on parenting programs and positive youth development projects. In her studies, she examined indigenous family processes (such as parental sacrifice, adolescent filial responsibilities, parenting perfectionism) that have contributed to adolescent development and wellbeing. Janet expands her study on overparenting, and has conducted longitudinal studies to examine the associations of overparenting with adolescent development in Chinese contexts. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn have made adverse impacts to Hong Kong families. Janet received a grant of $18.9 million from Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust to initiate the “Promoting Family Resilience” Project between 2021 and 2024.

Dr Ngai has been learning and practising the collaborative dialogic approach since she met Dr Harlene Anderson, one of the founders of the approach, in 2007. Her areas of clinical interest and specialty include couples counselling, parenting issues, and intergenerational relationship, infidelity, divorce recovery and remarriage, and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. For the past few years, she introduced the Open Dialogue approach, which is also based on social constructionism and dialogic theories, to Hong Kong. The Open Dialogue approach is the most successful treatment model for the most challenging mental illness such as psychosis in the world. After treatment, over 80% of the patients who suffered from psychosis recovered without medications and return to fulltime employment. Invited by Dr Jaakko Seikkula, Dr Ngai joined the Open Dialogue Trainers’ Programme conducted by Dialogic Partners and the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland between May 2018 to February 2020. \nIn the process of understanding the power of dialogic approaches, Dr Ngai came across interpersonal neurobiology that applies brain research to psychotherapy. In the meantime, she has been studying and exploring ways trauma treatment models can be integrated into systemic therapy. In addition, Dr Ngai applies the collaborative dialogic concepts in organizations. Along with other experienced family therapy teachers and practitioners, she established the Hong Kong Marriage and Family Therapy Association as the Founding President.",

  "text": "Dr Sabrina Su, obtained her PhD degree in September 2017. Dr Su enjoys doing mixed method studies about youth development, career support services, organisational behaviours, workplace wellbeing, and capacity building among youth practitioners. There are many mainstream social discourses which are unfavourable to our positive wellbeing, self-fulfilment, and interpersonal relationships. Informed by critical theories, Dr Su has a passion to develop new concepts, introduce new perspectives, improve existing concepts, and design conceptual frameworks and tools for enhancing human beings' holistic wellbeing. Her research studies were, are, and will be conducted with reference to a wide spectrum of settings, including workplace, family, school, and community. The potentials of her concepts, such as collective psychological ownership (CPO), experience-driven recognition (EDR), and more enabling others (MEO), are recognised by international reviewers in relation to promoting individual agency and shared agency of people for developing their sustainable career and life development in various contexts. \nBased on the critiques of territorial sense of psychological phenomenon for causing territorial behaviours or even groupthink, Dr Su developed a less-territorial notion of collective psychological ownership which consists of a general factor of co-ownership and two specific factors of shared decision-making and shared hardship endurance. With the support of her research partners, Dr Su launched a new stream of studies of psychological ownership in organisation contexts and revealed its associations with work engagement, burnout, job satisfaction, turnover intention, etc. \nDr Su has a few years of research experience in the fields of youth studies and youth career development. She is concerned about the career and life development of young people and particularly career development of youth at risk, such as youth not in education, employment or training (NEET), youth with prolonged social withdrawal behaviors (hikikomori and semi-hikikomori), educationally disadvantaged young people, youth with special education needs, and young mothers, etc. Dr Su is aspired to empower and enable various groups of young people by supporting them to transition from their comfort zone, to the zone of proximal development, and further to the zone of aspired development. The intervention framework developed by Dr Su and her research partner is named Experience-Driven Framework (ED framework) which comprises four domains, namely recognition, exposures, self-growth, and transferability (REST). \nInformed by the intersubjective perspective and the capability approach, Dr Su has been expanding her research on workplace wellbeing and self-fulfilment of human-helping professionals, such as social workers, teachers, nurses, and youth workers. Dr Su’s passion comes from conceptualisation and operationalisation. She believes that theories, practice, teaching, policy, and research are interrelated and interlocking. Dr Su designed a tool called Map of Self-Perceived Growth (MSPG) to support both narrative research and career counselling, which highlights the agency of respondents in voicing out and mapping out their experiences with the use of emoji icons and a 10-point Likert scale in an archived manner. She has also developed some knowledge and skills to support human-helping professionals to become more enabling and more empowering to their service users.",

The book contributes to promoting global public sociology by fostering cooperation between academics and civil society to explain the buyer-supplier power dynamic in transnational manufacturing. Dying for an iPhone was named a CHOICE recommended title in Social and Behavioral Sciences in January 2022 and featured in a SHARPS international event on May Day 2022.\nDr Chan is currently working on two projects. From the level of global production to local logistics, she has researched parcel delivery labor in China’s digital economy. By comparing two types of couriers—delivery station-based teams and platform-mediated, crowd-sourced workers—the findings will explicate the distinctive mechanisms of corporate control and the responses of both local and rural migrant couriers, legal reforms, and adaptive governance. Her second project examines national development strategies through the lens of skill acquisition, student internship, and apprenticeship. At a time of slowing economic growth, a shrinking pool of workers and an ageing population, vocational school graduates and apprentices could play a significant role in China’s industrial and technological upgrading if they were to receive appropriate training leading to better jobs.\nWith funding support from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation and the East and Inner Asia Council of the Association for Asian Studies, the Great Britain-China Centre, and the John Fell Oxford University Press Research Fund, among others, Dr Chan has published in sociology and China studies journals, including Critical Sociology, Current Sociology, Human Relations, Globalizations, The South Atlantic Quarterly, Modern China, Rural China, The China Review, Made in China Journal, Global Labour Journal, Journal of Labor and Society, New Labor Forum, New Politics, Critical Asian Studies, Inter-Asia Cultural Studies, Asian Studies, The Asia-Pacific Journal, Sociologias, Dissent, and New Technology, Work and Employment.\nDr Chan serves as an elected Vice President of the International Sociological Association’s Research Committee on Labour Movements (2018-2023).

  "text": "Dr Cheng Yuk Tin is a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Applied Social Sciences. He has dedicated his effort in nurturing reflective professionals with ethical sensitivity in his teaching. In the past 16 years, apart from delivering a clear, logically- structured content to the students, Dr Cheng has attempted to arouse students’ imagination and engage them in the lectures by using a wide variety of resources from movies, lyrics, comics, episodes from everyday life, historical records, examples from frontline practice, published reflections of professionals, etc. Students are engaged in in-depth reflections of their personal/professional experience through a series of case studies of their own and other students’ fieldwork/frontline experience.\nThrough trustful dialogues, students are encouraged to explore their own value framework. In these processes, students are facilitated to draw insights from the concepts and arguments they have learned in the lectures to critically reflect on their experiences as professionals. Besides, Dr Cheng has drawn out the existential implications of the concepts and arguments introduced. \nIn these years of teaching, Dr Cheng has made effort to address the affect dimension of learning in his lectures. By the use of songs and analysis of lyrics, he has helped students to attend to the practical implications of the philosophical concepts introduced for understanding the subtlety of emotions, values and relationships. Furthermore, by taking a reflexive turn, he has showed the existential relevance of the analysis introduced through an articulation of his experience.",

Before joining The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as an Assistant Professor in January 2021, he held positions as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Cambridge, and later as a Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at The University of Hong Kong.\nAs a health, social, and cross-cultural psychologist with experience working in the Departments of Sociology at both the University of Cambridge and HKU, Dr. Hui adopts a person-environment interactionist approach, integrating psychological and sociological perspectives in his interdisciplinary research. He identifies as a social scientist who has dedicated the early part of his career to understanding the mechanisms that promote or inhibit psychological and physical well-being. Specifically, Dr. Hui's research interests center on the nature of individual behaviors and psychological differences (e.g., prosocial behaviors and online behaviors), psychosocial and exercise interventions (e.g., hot yoga), natural environments (e.g., biodiversity), and social and cultural changes (e.g., privatization, migration, and globalization) that shape human well-being. He employs a range of quantitative research methods, including but not limited to meta-analysis, experience-sampling studies, diary studies, longitudinal studies, social experiments, big data analytics, and machine learning.\nDr. Hui's research has been published in top psychology journals (e.g., Psychological Bulletin, Current Opinion in Psychology, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Psychological Science, Social Psychological and Personality Science, Journal of Positive Psychology, and Psychosocial Intervention), as well as non-psychology journals (e.g., Youth and Society, Chinese Sociological Review, BMJ, and PLOS ONE). Driven by a desire to transform academic research outputs into practical applications that benefit humanity and create significant social impact, Dr. Hui is proud and honored that his research on prosociality and well-being has been featured by over 50 international media outlets (e.g., Forbes (US), Buffalo News (US), Daily Mail (UK), Aleteia (France), Gulf Today (UAE), El Heraldo (Mexico), Orissa Post (India), and Yahoo! News). As a result, his firm belief in generosity and kindness and their positive effects on oneself and others have reached a global audience.\nIn 2023, Dr. Hui was awarded the prestigious Rising Star recognition from the Association for Psychological Science, which further underscores his dedication and accomplishments in the field of psychology.\nDr. Hui is open to supervising graduate students. If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. study under his guidance, please send your CV to him via email.",

Students are encouraged to enhance their sensitivity to recognise the complexity and inter-connectedness of the problems and issues that confront people; to reflect upon and draw implications from examining the social, economic and political contexts that influence human service practitioners and their clients with individual, marital and family problems; to relate family-centred practice theories and systems therapy to their own practice; and to develop personalised professional styles. Characteristics This programme is designed for practising social workers and related human service professionals who are interested in working with individuals, couples and families. The programme is offered on a mixed-mode basis, with the majority of its subjects being taught on weekday evenings. Students who enrol in the 30-credit programme can either take an additional 13 credits (3 credits of coursework and 10 credits of clinical training) and prepare themselves for application for Clinical Membership in the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) or complete 21 credits and exit with a Postgraduate Diploma. This is one of the two specialisms under the Master of Arts in Social Work Programme. With a configuration of multiple subjects, the programme is the only one of its kind in postgraduate training in applied social sciences in Hong Kong. Allowing students from different specialisms to take subjects from the same pool of Electives is important in promoting their competence to learn and practice in a multidisciplinary context, which is one of the characteristics of a well-rounded professional. During the course of study, students are equipped with the knowledge that is necessary to make integrative links between classroom learning and practice in the field.",

The Child Development Centre will focus on:\nChild education to teach children an effective emotional management and to enhance their attention\nTraining for teachers to enhance their professional knowledge and skills, to equip them to promote child intellectual development and learning.\nParenting education to equip parents with the knowledge, skills and techniques to promote child development in all domains including brain function development, social skill development, emotional and behavioural management.\nIn response to the rising demand for all-round child development, PolyU also launched the Master of Educational and Child Psychology (MECP) programme in 2009 and the Master of Applied Psychology (MAP) in 2012. These programmes aim at training a group of workers who wish to work in educational settings and organizations that are relevant to child-adolescent workforce development. The Child Development Centre will provide a platform for the training of MECP as well as MAP students.\nResearch Development\nRigorous research is important to ensure that services to parents and children are effective. Towards this end, the Child Development Centre will:\nEngage in research to develop reliable and valid local instruments measuring child development, learning and behavior, as well as parenting.\nCollaborate with professionals in the evaluation of programmes and services for children and parents, to promote evidence-based practice.",

The talk, entitled “Who should receive what and why?\": Citizens' perceptions of deservingness and distributive justice in a multilayered welfare context”, was held face-to face for the first time in the International Scholar Talk Series on 9 March 2023. This talk is also one of APSS’ 50th Anniversary celebratory events.\nDuring her presentation, Dr THEISS examined how Polish citizens reflect on deservingness principles and how these notions are contextualised by the legacy of the Polish welfare state. The talk was moderated by Dr Qiaobing WU, Associate Professor and Associate Head of APSS. Dr Herbary CHEUNG, Research Assistant Professor of APSS, and several attendees joined the discussion on how people’s mindset of deservingness affects social policy implantation in Hong Kong and identified areas for possible research collaboration between UW and PolyU.\nThank Dr Maria THEISS for delivering an inspiring presentation!",

The Joint Programme Leaders of the BA (Hons) Scheme in Applied Social Sciences, Dr Kong YAM and Dr Raymond TAM, presented the key features and curriculum structure of this undergraduate programme to 34 Secondary 4 and 5 students. \nDuring the small group sharing session, members of the APSS Student Association shared their experiences of university life with the participants. Prof. Eric CHUI, Head of APSS, also welcomed the participants with a brief message before paying a visit to APSS CAVE cum Studio at Z Core.\nParticipants had the opportunity to explore the teaching facility in APSS's CAVE cum Studio. Not only did they get to see the state-of-the-art equipment in teaching and learning, but they also had the chance to use the facilities themselves. As part of the experience, the students were invited to join a video shooting session, providing the students with a unique glimpse into the world of video production and editing. Overall, this was an invaluable opportunity for participants to gain hands-on experience and to explore the exciting possibilities that await them in the field of applied social sciences.",

The partnership includes the establishment of a dual degree programme, staff and student exchange, joint research activities, participation in seminar and academic meetings, exchange of academic materials, and special short-term academic programmes. \nProf. David SHUM, Dean of the Faculty of Health and Social Sciences at PolyU, was invited to give the opening remarks. Prof. SHUM said, “Our Faculty of Health and Social Sciences and APSS have always been committed to nurturing professional service providers in the health and social sciences sectors. We strive to offer the best education for social and healthcare professionals, and we work towards innovative and impactful research that addresses complex social and health problems in society.”\nProf. Daniel PRZASTEK, Dean of the WNPiSM at UW, was delighted to see the strategic cooperation and collaboration between our two universities, especially the proposed dual-degree programme in the area of social policy.\nMarking this special occasion, Dr Aleksander DAŃDA, Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Hong Kong and Macau, was invited to give a congratulatory speech. Dr DAŃDA had high hopes that the partnership will facilitate students “to go into distant places, to see the differences with their own eyes and to understand the differences. By understanding, accept those different cultures.” \nThe MoU was signed by Prof. David SHUM and Prof. Daniel PRZASTEK. The signing was witnessed by Dr Aleksander DAŃDA, Prof. Kwok-yin WONG, Vice President (Education) of PolyU, and Prof. Ben YOUNG, Vice President (Student and Global Affairs) of PolyU.\nProf. Eric CHUI, Head of APSS, exchanged a souvenir with Prof. PRZASTEK, as a token of appreciation.

Around 150 university students and staff members participated in this Challenge.\nStudents from APSS guided visitors through the stories of social enterprises and start-ups. Visitors were also invited to play a puzzle game, which aimed at introducing two business model development toolkits for social enterprises. Visitors gained an appreciation and greater understanding of how social enterprises could benefit our society.\nOne of the co-organisers of the event was Spartan, a start-up established by a group of BA (Hons) in Social Policy and Social Entrepreneurship students. Spartan provides a platform with an artificial intelligence (AI) system that integrates job-matching, skills-enhancement tutorials, and CV enrichment. It is designed for students in post-secondary education, and it aims to help them be well-prepared for their future careers.\nThis was the first event organised by APSS that effectively bridged social enterprises, start-ups, and the university community.

Attendees also had a taste of how to use techniques such as narrative conversation in real-life situations. We received valuable feedbacks from them on the professional and helpful training offered by Dr LIT’s workshop.\nAPSS look forward to providing more workshops and training for community members in the future.\nWatch the workshop highlight video: https://youtu.be/uXcdtKhPa10",

In addition, our graduates were paired up for various experiential activities such as ‘two-scale-metaphor’, ‘don’t-do-what-you-think’, and ‘physicalising’. Our graduates offered remarkable feedbacks on the quality and level of training from Samuel’s workshop. APSS looks forward to providing more advanced ACT training for our graduates and alumni in the future.\nWe are very grateful to have spent the last day of 2022 in such a meaningful and fruitful event.
