  "text": "Background\nIn response to the increasing social need for Chinese medicine in Hong Kong, the School of Nursing of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) set up its Herbal Medicine Learning Centre in 2008 to provide a venue for Chinese medicinal education and practice, enhancing the student’s knowledge of Chinese medicine and advancing the development of Chinese medicine.\n1. Teaching\nTo strengthen Chinese medicinal education by providing a teaching, learning and practice venue. Through the studying of Chinese herbal medicine, food therapy and formula study, learning and practice, students will develop deeper understandings on the use of proprietary Chinese medicine; the prescription, formulation, preparation and processing of Chinese herbal medicine and decoction pieces; and Chinese medicinal food therapy. We aim to nurture all-rounded nursing professionals and provide an opportunity for students from other disciplines to gain more knowledge of Chinese medicine. \nTo prepare and train Chinese medicinal nursing professionals to meet the service demands of the Hong Kong’s Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, which will be opened in the future. \nTo enhance the student’s and the public’s general knowledge of Chinese medicine by providing educational information. \n2. Advance the Development of Chinese Medicine\nTo serve as a model for the Chinese medicine industry. Through the demonstration of a new dispensing practice, the Herbal Medicine Learning Centre can contribute to the enhancement of the professional standard of dispensers and other employees of the Chinese medicine industry, which will ultimately further the development of Chinese medicine and its advance on the road to modernization.\nTo promote regulation and standardization of Chinese medicine, which will enhance the safe use of Chinese medicine.\nTo lay the foundation for the modernization and internationalization of Chinese medicine through promotion of the concept of \"one medicinal substance, one name\", \"standardized names for Chinese medicine\", and emphasis on the importance of verification of the properties and origins of Chinese medicine.\nTo introduce a computerized management system to ensure the prescription, formulation, preparation and processing of Chinese herbal medicine be monitored by a qualified professional.\nTo establish a qualification accreditation and training system for employees of the Chinese medicine industry, e.g. registration of Chinese medicine pharmacists.\nTo promote the concept of division of prescribing from dispensing in Chinese medicine. We believe that this division will encourage double-checks and monitoring of the prescription and dispensing process by Chinese medicine professionals, which will enhance the safe use of Chinese medicine and protect patients' rights.\n3. Research\nTo participate in various research projects on Chinese medicine and Integrative Chinese and Western therapeutics. To adopt scientific approaches to studying of Chinese medicine and make full use of scientific knowledge to bring out the value and strengths of Chinese medicine. \n4. Computerized Operating & Management System:\nThe computerized operating and management system in the Herbal Medicine Learning Centre was designed and developed by the PolyU School of Nursing. The system can guide our users through the record keeping, prescription and dispensing processes.\nThe computerized data entry system is used to generate and print prescriptions.\nComputerized system is able to monitor the ordering, sale and storage of Chinese medicine.\nThe Smart Card System in the dispensing process provides fool proof information to ensure that the correct medicine is administered.\nAll prescribed decoction pieces are photographed for the records. These records can be used to keep track of the medicine administered.\nThe computerized system and the data stored is maintained and managed by information technology experts.\n5. Facilities\nDispensary Unit and Chinese Medicine Specimen\nTemperature and humidity are strictly controlled at the Chinese medicine store and the Dispensary Unit to ensure that all Chinese medicine is stored in a suitable environment.\nThe traditional solid wood cabinets for Chinese medicine storage may contain volatile organic compounds which can be released into the air and affect the users and the herbal medicine. Stainless steel Chinese medicine cabinets are therefore used in the Herbal Medicine Learning Centre to reduce the health risk.\nChinese medicine specimen is available in the forms of decoction pieces and prescribed soluble granules. The principle of \"one medicinal substance, one name\" is adopted in the Herbal Medicine Learning Centre. Under this principle, we have 600 species of Chinese medicinal materials in the form of decoction pieces, and over 300 species of herbs/medicinal materials in the form of soluble granules.\n6. Chinese Herbal Medicine Processing Unit\nProcessing brings specific impact to Chinese medicinal ingredients to meet demands for their clinical use. The processing equipment and utensils in this unit allow students to understand the principles and methods of processing Chinese medicinal ingredients. \n7. Decoction and Food Therapy Preparation Unit\nAllows students to learn the traditional and modern methods used in preparing Chinese medicine decoction and Chinese medicinal food therapy.\n8. Learning Resource Corner\nA place for self-learning and public education with reference books and a computer information unit showing information of Chinese herbal medicine.",

  "text": "Primary healthcare is an integral part of the entire healthcare system. The Government put forward the Primary Healthcare Blueprint (the Blueprint) at the end of last year, which proposed prevention-oriented and community-based strategies to improve the overall health of the general public.\nThe School of Nursing of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has launched a pilot mHealth health management mobile app with interactive nursing support. Research data shows the app empowers the elderly to monitor their chronic diseases and mental health conditions. An interdisciplinary team formed by healthcare professionals and social workers offer support to the elderly, such as providing timely medical referrals, thereby reducing the unplanned use of health services and enhancing elderly health management.\nThe mHealth app is jointly developed by The School of Nursing of PolyU and a local telecommunications company to help monitor the health condition of the elderly. When an abnormal vital sign (such as blood pressure, or blood glucose level) is detected, a registered nurse will be notified via the app and will contact the elderly person to understand their health condition. Another highlight of the mHealth app is the 24-hour nurse interaction function. By tapping one button in the app, the elderly can make a video call to a registered nurse to support and evaluate their health and mental condition.\nThe research team, led by Dr Arkers WONG, Assistant Professor of The School of Nursing of PolyU, recruited participants from five elderly service centres of the Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service. A total of 221 elderly aged 60 or above with at least one chronic condition(s) (including hypertension, pain or diabetes) participated in the study.\nThe study found that there was a significant increase in self-efficacy, a significant decrease in the level of depression, a reduction in the use of medical services, and an improvement in the quality of life* in physical aspects, after the elderly used the app for three to six months.\nHong Kong has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in the world. The number of Hospital Authority patients with chronic diseases is projected to reach three million in the coming decade by 2039, which will bring a heavy burden to the public healthcare system.\nDr Arkers WONG said, “There was a significant reduction in the unplanned use of health services and unplanned visits to general practitioners by 76% and 72% respectively, after the elderly used the mHealth app with nursing support for three months. This illustrates that the approach of combining nursing support and digital technology can relieve the pressure brought about by the rising demand for public medical services, helping to achieve the goals set out in the Blueprint to improve the overall health condition of the elderly.”\nThe research team recommends promoting the use of digital technology for health management among the elderly, and strengthening health-social collaboration on digital platforms. The research and development team will enhance the app, adding functions such as artificial intelligence, and incorporating content that is more suitable for the needs and preferences of the elderly so that they will continue to use the app, which will contribute to the goal of reducing public medical expenses.\n*Physical component summary of quality of life includes four domains, which are general health, physical functioning (e.g., climbing several floors, moderate activities), role activities (limited kinds of activities), and bodily pain.",

  "text": "About Us \nWelcome to the Centre of Evidence-based Practice for Health Care Policy: A JBI Affiliated Group\nWelcome to the Centre of Evidence-based Practice for Health Care Policy: A Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Affiliated Group. Our Centre is hosted by the School of Nursing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, a world leader in gerontological, mental health, cancer and palliative care and community health services research. We believe the addition of the JBI group based at PolyU will be integral in developing new research questions to address some of the key health priorities affecting Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area’s population. We also see our JBI group being prominent leaders in developing and advancing cost-effective and improved evidenced based practice. Our focus is not only on knowledge generation and translation but, also through systematic review and evidence implementation education.\nOur JBI team consists of experienced researcher’s in both qualitative and quantitative research methods along with advanced practice nurses from our clinical partners. We are part of a bigger Asia collaboration of JBI Centres of Excellence and Affiliated Groups and as the newest group we are proud to be part of this entity. Being a JBI affiliated group allows us to be strategic in identifying those key priority areas along with our key stakeholders in providing both the implementation and translational basis of nursing research based on the outcomes of our systematic reviews, meta-analysis and meta-syntheses. \nOur mission is to:\n“Develop clinical practice through active engagement in evidence-based knowledge generation, translation and implementation, clinical education, quality improvement and research”\nOur vision is to:\n“Focus on embedding evidence-enhanced practice through building organisational infrastructure to support and promote an evidence-based environment”\nIn particular our Groups objectives are threefold, to:\nSupport future and ongoing development of the nursing team in terms of translational research and evidence based systematic review training\nSupport the development of nursing practice by creating an environment of collaborative evidenced-based practice using translational research and practice development principles and \nSupport the development of service processes by establishing a test bed for new ideas and approaches to different models of working and care delivery within a nursing context.\nGlobal Network\nThe Centre of Evidence-based Practice for Health Care Policy is part of the JBI Global Collaboration and in particular forms part of the Asia Collaboration with 8 other countries including China, India, Japan, Myanmar, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea: https://jbi.global/global-reach/collaboration\nEducation & Training\nThe Centre of Evidence-based Practice for Health Care Policy will provide three short courses to support evidence synthesis and implementation using the following:\nComprehensive Systematic Review Training Programme (Qualitative & Quantitative)\nEvidence Implementation Training Programme\nScoping Review Workshop\nJBI Videos \nNews & Events\nComing soon\nResearch & Publications \nObjective\tThis systematic review investigates the effectiveness of simulation-based intervention versus active or passive control group on the empathy of informal caregivers of people with dementia and synthesizes their experience of the intervention.\t\nBackground\tEmpathy towards people with dementia is suggested as a critical ability required for caregivers leading to quality care and associated with better mental health. Grounded on the Kolb Learning Styles Model (Kolb, 1984), simulation-based intervention may enhance caregivers' empathy through concrete experience, reflective observation, and abstract conceptualization. Eventually, this lead to a new interaction approach with people with dementia. However, to what extent and how the simulation-based intervention impacts informal caregivers are unclear.\t\nReview Type\tMixed Methods\t\nSupervisor\tDr Daphne Cheung\t\nContact Details\t\nDaphne.cheung@poly.edu.hk\nObjective\tThere is a lack of clear or consistent advice or guidance in relation to the management of the self-harming behaviour of cutting oneself by service users in psychiatric in-patient units. Therefore, this review will investigate the effectiveness of harm-reduction approaches for self-cutting in the inpatient setting.\t\nBackground\tTo date there a very few scales that measures the attitudes to self-cutting alone. There are of course a number of self-harm scales, such as the Attitudes to Deliberate Self-Harm Questionnaire, the Self-Harm Antipathy Scale and the Self-Harm Inventory, but these tend to incorporate self-cutting within a range of self-harming behaviours. This alone is not seen as being problematic, however, given that self-cutting is the only form of ‘actual’ self-harm involving destruction of bodily tissue, potential harm-minimisation techniques could involve more context driven approaches such as advice on the use of sterile instruments, education on the safer areas of the body to cut or even supplying sterile razors or being present during a cutting event.\t\nReview Type\tComparative Meta-Analysis\t\nSupervisor\tDr Martin Christensen & Professor Geoff Dickens (Northumbria University)\t\nContact Details\t\nmartin.christensen@poly.edu.hk\nObjective\tThe objective of the review is to describe qualitativelythe clinical experience among nursing students during the Covid-19 pandemic.\t\nBackground\tCovid-19 has a significant impact on our lives and places immense pressure on the health care system in many countries. It is also a turning point in nursing education and clinical practice. To address the shortage in manpower, some universities allowed their nursing students to engage in clinical placement or work as auxiliary health staff to support health care professionals. While clinical practice during the pandemic could be stressful and challenging for nursing students. It is crucial to understand how nursing students experience during this transition period. Findings from this review could inform nursing education and training for a better response in a future health care crisis.\t\nReview Type\tQualitative Meta-Synthesis\t\nSupervisor\tDr Polly Ma & Dr Martin Christensen\t\nContact Details\t\npolly.hx.ma@polyu.edu.hk & martin.christensen@poly.edu.hk \nObjective\tThe objective of the review is to describe qualitatively older Asian peoples experiences of self-harm ideation.\t\nBackground\tSelf-harm in the elderly is becoming a major concern globally due to increasing social isolation, widowhood, poor physical and mental health, and rising healthcare costs. Self-harm is defined as any ‘act of poisoning or self-injury carried out by a person irrespective of motivation’ and does not include indirect self-harm like self-neglect. There is evidence suggesting that the incidence of self-harm, like suicide attempts, is amplified when the older person has received a terminal diagnosis or a chronic disease that will become debilitating over time.\t\nReview Type\tQualitative Meta-Synthesis\t\nSupervisor\tDr Polly Ma & Dr Martin Christensen\t\nContact Details\t\npolly.hx.ma@polyu.edu.hk & martin.christensen@poly.edu.hk \nObjective\tThe objective of the review was to evaluate the experience of pregnant women during the Covid-19 pandemic.\t\nBackground\tCOVID 19 pandemic has a great impact on our lives. Many countries imposed social distancing measures and lockdowns to prevent the transmission of the virus. Meanwhile, significant changes have also been implemented in health care settings. Many face-to-face consultations and physical visits were affected and restricted. Pregnant women are particularly affected both physically and mentally during this period. Partially due to physiological changes during pregnancy, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory infectious disease. Although the association of pregnancy and susceptibility of COVID-19 infection has not been established, more recent evidence has shown that pregnant women with covid-19 diagnosis may be at a higher risk of experiencing pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth, stillbirth, and maternal death. COVID-19 pandemic is also a significant source of stress for pregnant women. The prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the pandemic has been estimated to be 42% and 25%, respectively. Their adverse mental health status could lead to subsequent negative maternal and birth outcomes. Additionally, pregnant women need to cope with the same social distancing measures as the general public, such as reduced social activities, reduced access to routine antenatal care and parenting class. Changes in health and life routines could in turn place mental health burden on pregnant women.\t\nReview Type\tQualitative Meta-Synthesis\t\nSupervisor\tDr Polly Ma & Dr Martin Christensen\t\npolly.hx.ma@polyu.edu.hk & martin.christensen@poly.edu.hk \nPlease put at least one valid content allocate to this component.\nContact Us",

  "text": "Interventions for people with mental health challenges\nPeople with mental health challenges are one of the most marginalised, misunderstood, and disadvantaged groups in today's society. There is a current need for evidence-based, patient-centered, and usable interventions to be used in communities and treatment facilities for persons experiencing mental health challenges. Our research in this area produces scientific evidence and essential skills to develop, test, and establish physical and psychosocial interventions for clients and their families to improve self-management and illness outcomes. Our research focuses on, for example, the effectiveness of self-help interventions, eHealth, family-inclusive psychoeducational and supportive interventions, non-invasive therapeutic approaches for the treatment of psychiatric problems, and interventions for sleep disturbance. Throughout all of our work, the needs and experiences of users are highly respected and valued to ensure person-centered approaches.\nChallenging relationships, social adversity, and mental health\nPoor relational qualities and social adversities have a direct and lasting impact on mental health. These problems are pervasive and may occur in any setting, such as homes, schools, workplaces, and communities. Our research in this area aims to understand the causes, risk factors, and mental health sequelae associated with challenging relationships and social adversities. Early prevention and mental health promotion for individuals and groups in vulnerable and sensitive environments are also key components of our work. Some of our current research focuses on violence or aggressive behaviors in care settings, mental health promotion for underserved populations, effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to enhance youth resilience, and reducing stigma towards mental disorders. We actively work to motivate different professionals and engage patients and their families in our research and educational activities.",

The training is well supported by the Human Patient Simulator (HPS) and other latest technology.\nThe HPS is by far the most advanced simulation technology for training health professionals. The programmable scenarios provide flexibility in training and allow the simulator to respond instantly to users’ input data of actions and interventions in real-time. Together with the customised recording system, the HPS expedites lecturer-and-student instant feedback at debriefing sessions.\nThe ICU Lab has a ceiling-mounted pedant, which houses a ventilator, a cardiac monitor and several infusion pumps. The well designed and furnished facilities allow students to acquire critical care skills and learn how to manage patients with life-threatening illness. \nMental Health Nursing Laboratories\nIn response to the launching of the Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Mental Health Nursing programme in 2009, mental health nursing laboratories were established by the School to provide state-of-the-art facilities to support teaching and learning in mental health nursing. The first and second multi-purposed mental health nursing laboratories are located at FG408 and FG409. \nThe laboratories, equipped with audio visual equipment, are used for teaching students how to manage violence, interview and counsel clients, and conducted mental health assessment. It is here that our students learn the skills for performing behavior analysis, promoting mental health education, and providing child and adult mental health nursing, and psychiatric nursing interventions. \nA new mental health nursing laboratory located at AG057r opened in February 2013. This new audio-visual teaching and learning laboratory is designed for practice and assessment. The laboratory provides a venue for students to learn and apply evidence-based interventions, and for teachers to critique students’ performance in psychiatric and mental health nursing, and to assess the clinical competence of students.\nEquipped with state-of-the-art equipment, such as the audio visual equipment for video recording and playback, a mirror for self-awareness training, and a SMART Board interactive whiteboard, the laboratory provides opportunities for students to practise their assertive skills, communication skills and various psychotherapeutic skills that promote mental health and provide care for the mentally ill. \nThe audio-visual equipment is connected to the mental health nursing laboratory at FG409, which facilitates student learning in practice, and allows teachers to analyse students’ practice and assess various psychosocial skills. The laboratory is also used to test innovative clinical skills curriculum. The laboratory has a resource corner with useful references and information to promote learning. \nOur fourth new mental health nursing laboratory was open in August 2014. The new lab, located at GH189, is designed for teaching expressive therapy and play therapy. It is bigger than the mental health nursing lab located at FG 4th floor. The new space provides suitable settings for psychotherapy teaching, art therapy learning, child and adolescent mental health care activity and behavioural training.

Students can develop clinical competence, build multitasking skills, and enhance prioritization judgment and effective decision making abilities while practicing in this simulated environment. \nClick here to view the Virtual Hospital’s introduction video.\nStrengthening clinical reasoning\nThe clinical reasoning framework is integrated to the subjects throughout the curriculum. This emphasizes on the integration of theoretical and clinical knowledge and its application in clinical settings. It aims to strengthen students’ critical thinking and clinical decision-making abilities. \nPreparing students for clinical placement\nAll nursing subjects are linked closely with the clinical placement which starts from year 2 until completion of subjects related to basic nursing care. Prior to the clinical placement, students have an opportunity to participate in the Pre-clinical Workshops to sharpen their knowledge and skills. \nEquipping students for future career\nInter-professional Education is promoted in classrooms and piloted in simulated wards. Undergraduate students from the Faculty of Health and Social Science join in both classroom and extracurricular activities to enhance their communication skills, leadership abilities and develop mutual respect between health care professionals for their future collaborative practices. \nExpanding students’ horizon\nOffshore Clinical Placement Exchange programmes are offered which allow students to work and study in overseas and China’s hospitals. In addition, both local and overseas Primary Health Care experiences gained through the Service-Learning Subjects are recognised as clinical hours. \nApplying knowledge and developing nursing skills using high fidelity patient simulators\nThe School pioneered the use of high-fidelity patient simulators in the late 90s. The Dorothy WONG Intensive Care Laboratory, which was renovated in 2017, is a fully furnished intensive care unit with state-of-the-art facilities. Simulated clinical experiences are major learning and teaching strategies in all nursing therapeutics subjects. Simulated Wards and Gerontological Nursing Laboratory are available for students’ learning and practice in real-life settings. \nMentorship\nThroughout the year two to year three of the studies, our students are supervised by the teaching staff of the School directly or by the clinical teachers nominated by the hospitals as instructors in both subacute and acute settings for medical and surgical nursing. Honorary Clinical Instructors are invited to coach senior year students in specialty placement and during the long consolidation in their final year to bridge the theory and practice gap and to facilitate the transition from students to staff nurses.\nUseful Links\nUseful Links \nPlease put at least one valid content allocate to this component.",

The HPS is an integral part of all nursing therapeutics subjects and simulated clinical experiences are provided for nursing students to meet the future challenges in real life settings. The HPS in various nursing laboratories ranges from an infant, a child to full size manikins, with full audio-video recording functions that enable debriefing and reviewing of students’ performances. \nThe Dorothy Wong Intensive Care Laboratory, which was renovated in 2017, is a fully furnished intensive care unit with state-of-the-art facilities. The re-development was supported by the Large Equipment Fund for Teaching to facilitate innovative student learning. With the support of our clinical experts and the HPS, our students are able to practise safely and learn how to care critically ill patients by using the scenario-based learning system. The HPS allows students to develop clinical reasoning ability, leadership, communication, and psychomotor skills that are core competencies for nurses. \nThe HPS also supports the development of various research projects, such as projects related to interdisciplinary education.",

  "text": "The past of nursing is an integral part in shaping our present understanding and our future of this honorable profession. Hong Kong nursing has come a long way since its apprenticeship system of the British model in 1893. The history of Nursing points to a concerted effort in creating occupational cohesion and exclusivity. It has largely concerned with registration, professional status and education. The Hong Kong Nursing Board was established in 1931. Given the introduction of Nurses Registration (Amendment) Ordinance in 1997, it was re-named the Nursing Board as Nursing Council with a greater self regulation and involvement of its own profession. The current Nursing Council of Hong Kong is hence the statutory body for nurses in Hong Kong.\nA significant contextual understanding of changes in the nursing of Hong Kong also dated back in the 1990s with the health care reform, which had redefined the line of responsibilities for nursing under the direction of Hospital Authority, an independent statutory body managing all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Since then, the professional nurse was expected to possess a higher and broader level of competencies. The first full-time Bachelor of Science (honours) programme in Nursing was launched in 1990 at our university. The World Health Organization Global Advisory Group has recommended for countries, when appropriate, to move basic nursing education to university standards. As nursing continues to pursue its professionalization, the recognition of a formal position of nurse specialists during the health care reform in 1990’s has also lent itself to the current nursing role of the Advanced practice nurse in Hong Kong.\nOur programmes have been accredited by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong. Graduates of the BSc (Hons) Nursing are eligible for registration with the Council as Registered Nurse (General) upon completion of the programme requirement. On the other hand, graduates of the BSc (Hons) Mental Health Nursing are eligible for registration with the Council as Registered Nurse (Psychiatric).\nHence, there will be different professional recognitions given the career progression for nurses from a practice nurse as an entry registered nurse with a higher diploma or bachelor degree preparation to a specialty nurse with clinical experience, becoming an advanced practice nurse with master degree educational preparations. A new direction in addressing history of nursing is from a more inclusive point of view, an international perspective in recognizing our commonalities beyond the foci of our particular place, assuming an internationalized perspective to better understand the future of nursing. Nurses have endeavored to build a common knowledge base and culture, while there is great diversity in the theory and praxis of nursing. As the world around nursing has changed so too has the profession been challenged to grow and evolve. Common beliefs have raised new perspectives and new conceptions of nursing education and practice. This legacy of knowledge development in nursing will challenge future generations of scholars to continue to extend our body of knowledge in the care of persons and their families, communities, and the environment.",

  "text": "Project Title Project Status \nInternationalising the Student Learning Experience: Overseas visit programmes to San Jose State University, USA for BSN & BSMHN students (PI: Dr Sau Fong Leung)\n[Abstract]\nInternationalisation has become increasingly important in nursing curriculum with the growing need for nurses to be internationally oriented and culturally competent healthcare professionals in workplaces around the world. With the funding support from a Teaching and Learning Grant, a 4-week programme was designed for 4 baccalaureate nursing students consisting of exchange activities with in-bound US students (n=14) from San José State University and an overseas visit to US universities and mental health settings. Post-trip reflection and consolidation show that the programme has enhanced students’ cross-cultural and professional learning, their appreciation of different nursing practices in United States and their understanding of the American mental health care system. The programme has laid the foundation for a continuous collaboration with San José State University in terms of student exchange and teaching.\n[Deliverables]\nLeung, S. F. (2017, September 15).

Four students completed the overseas visit to US have achieved the intended objectives in understanding global nursing, participation in cross-cultural and professional learning, appreciation of different nursing practices in United States and development of cultural competence of care. Moreover, an online learning module was created from the learning resources collected and produced in the overseas visit, and it was incorporated into a mental health subject SN2704 which was well received by a majority of 111 students in semester 1 of 2017-2018 academic year. The online learning module has enriched students' learning experience from local to global mental health context and enhanced their cross-cultural and professional competence. The project has created a potential to enhance the internationalization of a mental health subject in the nursing curriculum and more collaboration with overseas institutions in student exchange and teaching.\n\tCompleted\t\nInternationalising the Student Learning Experience: Overseas visit programmes to Coventry University, UK for BSN & BSMHN students (PI: Dr YW Mak)\tCompleted\t\nLarge Equipment Fund for Teaching: CAE Healthcare HPS-010 Human Patient Simulator\n[Abstract]\nThe Large equipment fund attained for this project was for the purchase of the CAE Healthcare HPS 465 Human Patient Simulator (HPS) to replace the old model that has been used for over 10 years. Additional funding was received from the school of Nursing to renovate the laboratory with the new equipment installed. The laboratory was under renovation from May and over the summer and has recently been reopened in 2017-2018 academic year.

  "text": "Dear nursing institutions in four places on both sides of the Strait,\nWelcome to the website of the Chinese Consortium for Higher Nursing Education (the Consortium).\nThe Consortium was founded in December 2005 and was initiated by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. It was initially jointly established by 21 nursing schools in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\nThe goals of the Consortium are to exchange ideas, knowledge and experience in nurturing nursing professionals, advance the development of higher nursing education to the international level, exhibit the values of Chinese culture in higher nursing education, and serve the health needs of mankind.\nThe Consortium regularly conducts summer courses, training programmes, and topical discussions and meetings (among member schools) for exchanging ideas. The Consortium has grown over the past fifteen years. As of 2020, the Consortium has around 100 membership of nursing institutions. The West China School of Nursing, Sichuan University, was the convenor of the Consortium in 2012 and 2015. We have taken up the role again in 2019 and 2020.\nThe West China School of Nursing, Sichuan University, embraces the values of interdisciplinary collaboration and resource sharing. We continue to innovate nursing practice and cultivate innovative nursing talents for promotion and maintenance of well-being of mankind. In 2017, the nursing discipline of the School was included in the “Double First-Class” Initiative discipline construction projects under the Ministry of Education. In 2019, the School was among the first batch of First-Class Undergraduate Discipline Construction Sites, approved by the Ministry of Education. From 2016-2019, for four consecutive years, the nursing discipline of the School topped the Science and Technology Evaluation Metrics (Chinese medical institutes) of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank the member schools for their enthusiastic and sincere support over the years. During our convenorship, we will continue to contribute ourselves for the development of the Consortium. The Consortium will continue to act as a bridge between members, be driven by creativity, and provide a leading and scientific-based academic exchange platform for fostering collaboration, innovation, and academic discussions on hot healthcare topics. We hope that we live up to your expectations and share the latest achievements of member institutions for enhancing higher nursing education development in Greater China.\nNursing has a long history of development in our region. Let us join hands and work together! Through exchange and close cooperation, we share and use the international nursing educational resources, integrate the essence of the Eastern and Western nursing education, keep updating our philosophies of education, maintain our teaching and learning quality at a high level, and try to attain the world-class nursing education. Let us nurture excel nursing professionals, who have profound Chinese cultural values and innovative minds, to take up nursing leadership in the future and provide quality health care services for the benefits of mankind.",

  "text": "香港理工大学（理大）今天宣布与日本电气香港有限公司（NECHK）签署了一份谅解备忘录（MoU），将推出专为长者及其护理人员而设的智能互动社交机械人。一系列研究项目将逐步展开，从而探究长者使用社交机械人的效果，当中可怎样帮助长者提升自理能力、鼓励他们积极参与社交活动，达致维持身心健康的生活。\n我期望 NECHK 与理大护理学院的合作，将会为人口老龄化和居家养老的这一个新趋势，提供创新解决方案。\n赵汝恒教授\n理大副校长（研究及创新）\n理大护理学院副学院主任（研究）梁绮雯教授带领团队与 NECHK 合作，引入五部社交机械人，为长者提供生活陪伴和日常家居生活的支援。此外，该团队将通过机械人开展一系列名为「长者及其照顾者使用社交机械人」的研究课题。\n理大副校长（研究及创新）赵汝恒教授表示:「理大很荣幸能够与 NECHK 成为合作伙伴。NECHK 作为整合 IT 和网络技术的领导者，促进个人和社区的安全并提高生活质量，这与理大一直致力推动知识创新和应用研究，以回应社会需求的目标不谋而合。我期望 NECHK 与理大护理学院的合作，将会为人口老龄化和居家养老的这一个新趋势，提供创新解决方案。」\n第一项正在进行的研究是「社区居住华人长者居家使用人型机械人的表现」，主要调查长者是否接受并喜欢在家中与机械人互动沟通，以及机械人对长者的孤独感、认知、药物依从性以及心理和社交生活的初步影响效果。这些人工智能机械人能使用粤语与长者互动沟通。人机智能的交互体验是关键——长者通过口头指令机械人打开电视新闻频道、播放音乐，以及打电话给家人和朋友聊天，并能在预设的时间，对一些特定的常规活动，预设温馨提醒例如服药、吃饭等。\nNECHK 董事总经理黄玉娟女士表示：「NEC 社交机械人专为长者护理服务而开发，特别为认知障碍症老人而设的「陪伴机器人」，以改善长者的社交互动和沟通能力，并为他们的照顾者提供支援，从而减少照顾者的工作量。机械人能够以广东话及拟人表达方式进行互动式沟通，亦能为长者提供个人化设定，配合其个人喜好的功能和使用习惯， 以达致人性化的智能养老服务。 」\n理大医疗及社会科学院院长岑浩强教授表示：「香港为全球最长寿的地区之一，并正迅速进入超高龄化社会。当父母退休或子女相续迁出后，年长人士的社交活动或人际互动亦随着减少，长远而言或会损害他们的身心灵。有见及此，理大护理学院与日本电气香港有限公司合作进行研究项目，探讨社交机械人能否有效地填补部分人际互动的空隙，以及增强长者的社交和自理能力。」\n居家养老已经被视为人口老龄化的一个趋势和解决方案。梁绮雯教授相信透过使用社交机械人，能提升独居长者的自我照护能力之余，更能帮助他们与外界接触和促进人际交流。在创新技术的支持下，长者能够健康地生活并融入社区。\n理大副校长（研究及创新）赵汝恒教授及 NECHK 董事总经理黄玉娟女士代表签署合作协议。\n理大护理学院\n护理学院拥有不同专长的学者及临床专家，以「创新护理、惠泽全人」为目标，发展有实用价值的医护新知。护理学院致力促进和运用循证护理实践，回应市民需要，贡献社会，并在国家及国际层面推动护理学术发展。护理学院的研究成果及创新产品多样化，广泛涵盖医疗及护理议题，包括：耆年健康、家庭与社区健康、精神健康、过渡期照顾，支援及纾缓护理等。\n日本电气香港（NECHK）\n日本电气香港有限公司成立于一九八四年，业务迅速扩展，以迎合香港，澳门及中国客户的需求。作为整合 IT 和网络技术的领导者，NEC 提供创新的解决方案，为社会创造安全、保障、平等和效率的社会价值，以实现社会可持续发展，并创造个人发挥潜能的机会，以建立更繁荣的生活。",

  "text": "WHO Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services \nAbout Us \nWorld Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services\nThe WHO has designated the School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services since December 2007. Through implementing the WHO's mandate, the School has been playing a proactive role in strengthening evidence-based community health services and improving the health outcomes of local, regional and global populations. The World Health Organization has recently redesignated our School’s WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) for Community Health Services for a period of four years to December 2023. It was agreed with WHO that we would change the focus of our WHO CC to align with one of the WHO current strategic priorities: healthy ageing. The following are the key foci of our activity: \nUnderstand key indicators of ageing and health in the countries in Western Pacific Region.\nPromote WHO Guidelines on Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) and develop initiatives to disseminate and implement it in Western Pacific Region countries.\nConsolidate good practices and policies that ensure healthy lives and promote well-being of older people in the Western Pacific Region.\nA series of work plans, including collaborative research projects, roundtable sessions, training workshops and so on related to Healthy Ageing, will be developed in conjunction with WHO. This redesignated WHO CC unit on ‘Healthy Ageing’, the first and only WHO collaborating centre on ‘Ageing’ in Asia and the Pacific at this juncture, will assist the Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) to roll out its strategic initiatives on ageing for the region. \nDirector: Prof. Angela LEUNG\t\nDeputy Director: Dr Stefanos TYROVOLAS\t\nCommunications Manager: Miss Helen HSU\t\nThe team of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services (WHO CC), School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University is composed of a group of prominent health professionals. \nInternal Members (School of Nursing, PolyU)\t\nProf. Angela LEUNG, Director of WHO CC, Professor & Associate Head (Research)\nDr Stefanos TYROVOLAS, Deputy Director of WHO CC, Assistant Professor\nDr Justina LIU, Associate Professor\nDr Daphne CHEUNG, Associate Professor\nDr Patrick KOR, Assistant Professor\nDr Ivy ZHAO, Research Assistant Professor\nDr Shanshan WANG, Research Assistant Professor\nDr Jingjing SU, Research Assistant Professor\nDr Shirley LO, Clinical Associate\nDr Shuanglan LIN, Postdoctoral Fellow\nDr Yaqi HUANG, Postdoctoral Fellow\nDr Hammoda Abu ODAH, Research Fellow\nDr Mian WANG, Postdoctoral Fellow\nInternational Advisory Committee Members\t\nProf. Kirsten N.

  "text": "WHO Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services \nWorld Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services\nThe WHO has designated the School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services since December 2007. Through implementing the WHO's mandate, the School has been playing a proactive role in strengthening evidence-based community health services and improving the health outcomes of local, regional and global populations. The World Health Organization has recently redesignated our School’s WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) for Community Health Services for a period of four years to December 2023. It was agreed with WHO that we would change the focus of our WHO CC to align with one of the WHO current strategic priorities: healthy ageing. The following are the key foci of our activity: \nUnderstand key indicators of ageing and health in the countries in Western Pacific Region.\nPromote WHO Guidelines on Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) and develop initiatives to disseminate and implement it in Western Pacific Region countries.\nConsolidate good practices and policies that ensure healthy lives and promote well-being of older people in the Western Pacific Region.\nA series of work plans, including collaborative research projects, roundtable sessions, training workshops and so on related to Healthy Ageing, will be developed in conjunction with WHO. This redesignated WHO CC unit on ‘Healthy Ageing’, the first and only WHO collaborating centre on ‘Ageing’ in Asia and the Pacific at this juncture, will assist the Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) to roll out its strategic initiatives on ageing for the region. \nDirector: Prof. Angela LEUNG\t\nDeputy Director: Dr Stefanos TYROVOLAS\t\nCommunications Manager: Miss Helen HSU\t\nThe team of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Community Health Services (WHO CC), School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University is composed of a group of prominent health professionals. \nInternal Members (School of Nursing, PolyU)\t\nProf. Angela LEUNG, Director of WHO CC, Professor & Associate Head (Research)\nDr Stefanos TYROVOLAS, Deputy Director of WHO CC, Assistant Professor\nDr Justina LIU, Associate Professor\nDr Daphne CHEUNG, Associate Professor\nDr Patrick KOR, Assistant Professor\nDr Ivy ZHAO, Research Assistant Professor\nDr Shanshan WANG, Research Assistant Professor\nDr Jingjing SU, Research Assistant Professor\nDr Shirley LO, Clinical Associate\nDr Shuanglan LIN, Postdoctoral Fellow\nDr Yaqi HUANG, Postdoctoral Fellow\nDr Hammoda Abu ODAH, Research Fellow\nDr Mian WANG, Postdoctoral Fellow\nInternational Advisory Committee Members\t\nProf. Kirsten N.

Our Centre is hosted by the School of Nursing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, a world leader in gerontological, mental health, cancer and palliative care and community health services research.

We also see our JBI group being prominent leaders in developing and advancing cost-effective and improved evidenced based practice. Our focus is not only on knowledge generation and translation but, also through systematic review and evidence implementation education.\nOur JBI team consists of experienced researcher’s in both qualitative and quantitative research methods along with advanced practice nurses from our clinical partners. We are part of a bigger Asia collaboration of JBI Centres of Excellence and Affiliated Groups and as the newest group we are proud to be part of this entity. Being a JBI affiliated group allows us to be strategic in identifying those key priority areas along with our key stakeholders in providing both the implementation and translational basis of nursing research based on the outcomes of our systematic reviews, meta-analysis and meta-syntheses. \nOur mission is to:\n“Develop clinical practice through active engagement in evidence-based knowledge generation, translation and implementation, clinical education, quality improvement and research”\nOur vision is to:\n“Focus on embedding evidence-enhanced practice through building organisational infrastructure to support and promote an evidence-based environment”\nIn particular our Groups objectives are threefold, to:\nSupport future and ongoing development of the nursing team in terms of translational research and evidence based systematic review training\nSupport the development of nursing practice by creating an environment of collaborative evidenced-based practice using translational research and practice development principles and \nSupport the development of service processes by establishing a test bed for new ideas and approaches to different models of working and care delivery within a nursing context.",

  "text": "Interventions for people with mental health challenges\nPeople with mental health challenges are one of the most marginalised, misunderstood, and disadvantaged groups in today's society. There is a current need for evidence-based, patient-centered, and usable interventions to be used in communities and treatment facilities for persons experiencing mental health challenges. Our research in this area produces scientific evidence and essential skills to develop, test, and establish physical and psychosocial interventions for clients and their families to improve self-management and illness outcomes. Our research focuses on, for example, the effectiveness of self-help interventions, eHealth, family-inclusive psychoeducational and supportive interventions, non-invasive therapeutic approaches for the treatment of psychiatric problems, and interventions for sleep disturbance. Throughout all of our work, the needs and experiences of users are highly respected and valued to ensure person-centered approaches.\nChallenging relationships, social adversity, and mental health\nPoor relational qualities and social adversities have a direct and lasting impact on mental health. These problems are pervasive and may occur in any setting, such as homes, schools, workplaces, and communities. Our research in this area aims to understand the causes, risk factors, and mental health sequelae associated with challenging relationships and social adversities. Early prevention and mental health promotion for individuals and groups in vulnerable and sensitive environments are also key components of our work. Some of our current research focuses on violence or aggressive behaviors in care settings, mental health promotion for underserved populations, effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to enhance youth resilience, and reducing stigma towards mental disorders. We actively work to motivate different professionals and engage patients and their families in our research and educational activities.",

  "text": "Interventions for people with mental health challenges\nPeople with mental health challenges are one of the most marginalised, misunderstood, and disadvantaged groups in today's society. There is a current need for evidence-based, patient-centered, and usable interventions to be used in communities and treatment facilities for persons experiencing mental health challenges. Our research in this area produces scientific evidence and essential skills to develop, test, and establish physical and psychosocial interventions for clients and their families to improve self-management and illness outcomes. Our research focuses on, for example, the effectiveness of self-help interventions, eHealth, family-inclusive psychoeducational and supportive interventions, non-invasive therapeutic approaches for the treatment of psychiatric problems, and interventions for sleep disturbance. Throughout all of our work, the needs and experiences of users are highly respected and valued to ensure person-centered approaches.\nChallenging relationships, social adversity, and mental health\nPoor relational qualities and social adversities have a direct and lasting impact on mental health. These problems are pervasive and may occur in any setting, such as homes, schools, workplaces, and communities. Our research in this area aims to understand the causes, risk factors, and mental health sequelae associated with challenging relationships and social adversities. Early prevention and mental health promotion for individuals and groups in vulnerable and sensitive environments are also key components of our work. Some of our current research focuses on violence or aggressive behaviors in care settings, mental health promotion for underserved populations, effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to enhance youth resilience, and reducing stigma towards mental disorders. We actively work to motivate different professionals and engage patients and their families in our research and educational activities.",

The centre, launched on 29 March, is Hong Kong’s FIRST school of nursing’s operated pop-up community vaccination centre. With the enthusiastic support of our strong-team of 300 students, teaching staff members and alumni, we directly back the Government’s campaign in boosting vaccination to protect vulnerable populations against the Omicron infection. Under the guidance and supervision of our clinical supervisors and alumni, final-year nursing students administer the BioNTech vaccine to clients and observe clients resting at the sickbay for any adverse effects after vaccination. \nThe Caroline Hill Road Pop-Up Community Vaccination Centre (CVC)\nHong Kong Red Cross COVID-19 Support Hotline & Aftercare Service To Help People Coping With COVID-19\n28 March 2022\nMs Joyce Tang, Clinical Coordinator (Mental Health Nursing) and Dr Bryan Ho, Deputy Programme Leader of the BSc (Hons) in Mental Health Nursing programme initiated to support the Hong Kong Red Cross Covid-19 Support Hotline and aftercare service to provide psychological support, health assessment, as well as education and social services to the public.

In response to the Government’s setting up of community isolation facilities to resolve this crisis, the School joined hands with the School of Nursing, Tung Wah College, to conduct N95 respirator fit tests for over 200 nursing staff and nursing students from Hong Kong Baptist University’s School of Continuing Education, to prepare them for serving at the Kai Tai Holding Centre, which accommodates frail senior COVID-19 patients for isolation and temporary care.\nHong Kong Baptist University’s School of Nursing\nStudents Supported The Community Vaccination Centre\n23 March 2022\nResponding to the request of the Sham Shui Po District Health Centre (SSPDHC), forty year-3 nursing students of the BSc (Hons) in Nursing (Senior Year) programme were in the front line to support the community vaccination centre at the SSPDHC. They assisted in eligibility screening, assessed clients’ health before obtaining consent for vaccination, administered COVID-19 vaccines to clients under supervision, and observed clients resting at the sick bay for any adverse effects after vaccination. The activity has offered a beneficial opportunity for nursing students to gain hands-on experience and broaden their perspectives in community services.\nSham Shui Po District Health Centre (SSPDHC)\nWebinars To Enhance COVID-19 Literacy Of Ethnic Minorities\n19 March - 9 April 2022\nTo enhance COVID-19 literacy and infection control knowledge of ethnic minorities living in Hong Kong, the School’s WHO CC for Community Health Services joined hands with ethnic minority organizations (co-organisers):Tung Chung Tamil Muslim Jamath, Dompet Dhuafa Association, Idara Minhaj Ul Quran HK, and Ethnic Minority Health and Education Service Hong Kong, to hold a series of COVID-19 webinars. The representatives of the organisations from different communities, were invited to participate in the webinars and provide simultaneous interpretations in different languages (such as Hindi and Urdu) for the events.\nWHOCC for Community Health Services \nEstablished Call Centre To Support HA Hotlines\n19 March 2022\nAt the time when local hospitals were overwhelmed by soaring Omicron cases, the School set up an on-campus call centre to support the HA (Hospital Authority) hotlines. Ten HA hotlines were operated by the School from 8am to 10 pm with nearly 600 calls each day. Our teaching staff members and final year undergraduate nursing students provided timely support, nursing and infection control advice to infected patients and their families.\nHospital Authority’s COVID-19 hotline\nDistributed Medical Supplies To Nursing Homes\n11 March 2022\nCare homes were the epicentre of the Omicron outbreak, accounting for nearly 60 percent of all deaths since January 2022. Upon receiving tons of medical supplies from our donors, the School swiftly organised distribution of the supplies to the local nursing homes to support senior or frail residents fighting against Omicron infection. Over 291,000 medical supplies (including 44,000 rapid antigen test kits, 213,600 pieces of respirators/face masks, etc.) reached the hands of staff and residents of over 200 local nursing homes. \nDelivered Videos To Enhance Infection Control In RCHs\n2 March 2022\nWith the support of the School’s Squina International Centre for Infection Control, we responded to the plea for assistance from Po Leung Kuk, an operator of local residential care homes (RCHs) and delivered videos on how to gown up and gown off personal protective equipment and N95 respirators to the RCHs. We particularly refreshed the videos on three care procedures: napkin changing, oral feeding, and nasogastric tube feeding, with emphasis on infection control measures, to guide and update the healthcare workers how to manage every day care and nursing procedures with infection control measures. \nSquina International Centre for Infection Control\nStudents Volunteer In Community Isolation Facility\n21 February 2022\nAt the time when Omicron cases hit a new high, the School responded to the invitation of Po Leung Kuk by encouraging senior year nursing students (including mental health nursing) to volunteer in the Choi Wing Road Community Isolation Facility and assist in basic nursing care or administrative duties.

The centre, launched on 29 March, is Hong Kong’s FIRST school of nursing’s operated pop-up community vaccination centre. With the enthusiastic support of our strong-team of 300 students, teaching staff members and alumni, we directly back the Government’s campaign in boosting vaccination to protect vulnerable populations against the Omicron infection. Under the guidance and supervision of our clinical supervisors and alumni, final-year nursing students administer the BioNTech vaccine to clients and observe clients resting at the sickbay for any adverse effects after vaccination. \nThe Caroline Hill Road Pop-Up Community Vaccination Centre (CVC)\nHong Kong Red Cross COVID-19 Support Hotline & Aftercare Service To Help People Coping With COVID-19\n28 March 2022\nMs Joyce Tang, Clinical Coordinator (Mental Health Nursing) and Dr Bryan Ho, Deputy Programme Leader of the BSc (Hons) in Mental Health Nursing programme initiated to support the Hong Kong Red Cross Covid-19 Support Hotline and aftercare service to provide psychological support, health assessment, as well as education and social services to the public.

Our teaching staff members and final year undergraduate nursing students provided timely support, nursing and infection control advice to infected patients and their families.\nHospital Authority’s COVID-19 hotline\nDistributed Medical Supplies To Nursing Homes\n11 March 2022\nCare homes were the epicentre of the Omicron outbreak, accounting for nearly 60 percent of all deaths since January 2022. Upon receiving tons of medical supplies from our donors, the School swiftly organised distribution of the supplies to the local nursing homes to support senior or frail residents fighting against Omicron infection. Over 291,000 medical supplies (including 44,000 rapid antigen test kits, 213,600 pieces of respirators/face masks, etc.) reached the hands of staff and residents of over 200 local nursing homes. \nDelivered Videos To Enhance Infection Control In RCHs\n2 March 2022\nWith the support of the School’s Squina International Centre for Infection Control, we responded to the plea for assistance from Po Leung Kuk, an operator of local residential care homes (RCHs) and delivered videos on how to gown up and gown off personal protective equipment and N95 respirators to the RCHs.

  "text": "護理教育包含課室教學和臨床實習，惟在新冠疫情下，面授課堂和臨床實習均受影響。香港理工大學（理大）護理學院副教授雷逸華博士及高級專任導師陳玉儀博士率領團隊，利用虛擬實境技術，開發「虛擬醫院學習系統」(下稱「虛擬醫院」)，提供創新的「臨床」培訓，以提升護理學生的學習體驗和成效。\n「虛擬醫院」是本港首個同類型的虛擬教學系統，模擬真實醫院病房複雜多變的環境。系統目前設有五個模擬情境，共11個遊戲，包括「臨床實習簡介」、「譫妄患者的挑戰」、「同時處理多個護理任務」、「預防錯失」，以及「心肌栓塞」。系統可隨機提供逾1,200個處境和多項選擇組合，因此學生參與遊戲時，難以預測即將面對的情境，並須即時評估患者狀況和詮釋醫療資料，以作出適當的護理決定。\n陳玉儀博士表示：「現時大部分虛擬實境學習系統偏重於基礎護理知識，以訓練護理操作和程序為主要教學目標，情景設置亦為一床一病患。而理大的『虛擬醫院』要求學生同時處理多張病床及照顧多名患者，期間會出現各式突發事故和臨床護理陷阱，考驗學生面對各種干擾時，如何運用所學，在限時內決定護理優次，系統有助提升其觀察力、臨床應變能力、決策能力，及溝通技巧等。」\n在「虛擬醫院」中，學生對病人的回應和作出的護理決定可經等離子電視顯示，系統設有錄音功能記錄學生與虛擬患者的對答，供師生之後討論；而多項選擇題功能，讓學生即時反思自己的臨床判斷和決定。遊戲數據和系統的自動評估功能亦便利教師跟進學習進度和評估學習成果。\n「虛擬醫院」於本年一月正式啟用，現時已有逾450名護理學生使用。雷逸華博士表示：「『虛擬醫院』提供以個案為本、合作解難的學習機會。配合學院目前使用的模擬病人教學系統，我期望『虛擬醫院』可進一步幫助學生掌握臨床護理所需的專業技能，減低學生在現實臨床環境中出錯。」\n她續說：「我們很高興這套虛擬學習系統獲得學生正面回饋，期望未來將這套系統擴展至跨專業、跨學科的虛擬實境遊戲，並推廣至本地以至大灣區的其他護士學校。」\n理大護理學院三年級學生鄭子詠認為「虛擬醫院」的場景細節逼真，透過這套學習系統，每位同學均有機會單獨應對護理難題，從而感受到護士面對繁重工作時的緊張情緒和壓力，有助增強他們進行臨床實習的信心。\n按此觀看「虛擬醫院學習系統」的簡介影片。",

Hong Kong nursing has come a long way since its apprenticeship system of the British model in 1893. The history of Nursing points to a concerted effort in creating occupational cohesion and exclusivity. It has largely concerned with registration, professional status and education. The Hong Kong Nursing Board was established in 1931. Given the introduction of Nurses Registration (Amendment) Ordinance in 1997, it was re-named the Nursing Board as Nursing Council with a greater self regulation and involvement of its own profession. The current Nursing Council of Hong Kong is hence the statutory body for nurses in Hong Kong.\nA significant contextual understanding of changes in the nursing of Hong Kong also dated back in the 1990s with the health care reform, which had redefined the line of responsibilities for nursing under the direction of Hospital Authority, an independent statutory body managing all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Since then, the professional nurse was expected to possess a higher and broader level of competencies. The first full-time Bachelor of Science (honours) programme in Nursing was launched in 1990 at our university. The World Health Organization Global Advisory Group has recommended for countries, when appropriate, to move basic nursing education to university standards. As nursing continues to pursue its professionalization, the recognition of a formal position of nurse specialists during the health care reform in 1990’s has also lent itself to the current nursing role of the Advanced practice nurse in Hong Kong.\nOur programmes have been accredited by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong.

On the other hand, graduates of the BSc (Hons) Mental Health Nursing are eligible for registration with the Council as Registered Nurse (Psychiatric).\nHence, there will be different professional recognitions given the career progression for nurses from a practice nurse as an entry registered nurse with a higher diploma or bachelor degree preparation to a specialty nurse with clinical experience, becoming an advanced practice nurse with master degree educational preparations. A new direction in addressing history of nursing is from a more inclusive point of view, an international perspective in recognizing our commonalities beyond the foci of our particular place, assuming an internationalized perspective to better understand the future of nursing. Nurses have endeavored to build a common knowledge base and culture, while there is great diversity in the theory and praxis of nursing. As the world around nursing has changed so too has the profession been challenged to grow and evolve. Common beliefs have raised new perspectives and new conceptions of nursing education and practice. This legacy of knowledge development in nursing will challenge future generations of scholars to continue to extend our body of knowledge in the care of persons and their families, communities, and the environment.",

  "text": "Project Title Project Status \nInternationalising the Student Learning Experience: Overseas visit programmes to San Jose State University, USA for BSN & BSMHN students (PI: Dr Sau Fong Leung)\n[Abstract]\nInternationalisation has become increasingly important in nursing curriculum with the growing need for nurses to be internationally oriented and culturally competent healthcare professionals in workplaces around the world. With the funding support from a Teaching and Learning Grant, a 4-week programme was designed for 4 baccalaureate nursing students consisting of exchange activities with in-bound US students (n=14) from San José State University and an overseas visit to US universities and mental health settings. Post-trip reflection and consolidation show that the programme has enhanced students’ cross-cultural and professional learning, their appreciation of different nursing practices in United States and their understanding of the American mental health care system. The programme has laid the foundation for a continuous collaboration with San José State University in terms of student exchange and teaching.\nLeung, S. F. (2017, September 15).

Poster presented at the School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.\nPlease clickhere.\n[Impact Highlights]\nThe project has positive impact on students' approach of learning, personal growth and professional competence. Four students completed the overseas visit to US have achieved the intended objectives in understanding global nursing, participation in cross-cultural and professional learning, appreciation of different nursing practices in United States and development of cultural competence of care. Moreover, an online learning module was created from the learning resources collected and produced in the overseas visit, and it was incorporated into a mental health subject SN2704 which was well received by a majority of 111 students in semester 1 of 2017-2018 academic year. The online learning module has enriched students' learning experience from local to global mental health context and enhanced their cross-cultural and professional competence. The project has created a potential to enhance the internationalization of a mental health subject in the nursing curriculum and more collaboration with overseas institutions in student exchange and teaching.\n\tCompleted\t\nInternationalising the Student Learning Experience: Overseas visit programmes to Coventry University, UK for BSN & BSMHN students (PI: Dr YW Mak)\tCompleted\t\nLarge Equipment Fund for Teaching: CAE Healthcare HPS-010 Human Patient Simulator\nThe Large equipment fund attained for this project was for the purchase of the CAE Healthcare HPS 465 Human Patient Simulator (HPS) to replace the old model that has been used for over 10 years. Additional funding was received from the school of Nursing to renovate the laboratory with the new equipment installed. The laboratory was under renovation from May and over the summer and has recently been reopened in 2017-2018 academic year. This intensive care patient simulator care model is the only physiological based with pre-configured simulated clinical experiences to be used by students at the School of Nursing.\nTwenty clinical track staff and lecturers of nursing subjects from the school attended the training on the use of this simulator. Faculty member from Rehabilitation Sciences were also invited to join the training sessions. Both local and overseas training were completed in this year and the HPS was in full operation during the semester. All undergraduate students have the opportunity to use the HPS as part of their simulated clinical experiences. Inter-professional education was piloted with great success and received a Teaching and Learning Grant for the development of a new teaching module for students of allied health and nursing professions.\nThe simulated clinical experiences have enriched the students’ learning and were considered as one of the major learning and teaching strategies in the preparation of professional nurses.

  "text": "Project Title Project Status \nInternationalising the Student Learning Experience: Overseas visit programmes to San Jose State University, USA for BSN & BSMHN students (PI: Dr Sau Fong Leung)\nInternationalisation has become increasingly important in nursing curriculum with the growing need for nurses to be internationally oriented and culturally competent healthcare professionals in workplaces around the world. With the funding support from a Teaching and Learning Grant, a 4-week programme was designed for 4 baccalaureate nursing students consisting of exchange activities with in-bound US students (n=14) from San José State University and an overseas visit to US universities and mental health settings. Post-trip reflection and consolidation show that the programme has enhanced students’ cross-cultural and professional learning, their appreciation of different nursing practices in United States and their understanding of the American mental health care system. The programme has laid the foundation for a continuous collaboration with San José State University in terms of student exchange and teaching.\nLeung, S. F. (2017, September 15).

Y. (2018, Feb). San José State University, California of US. Poster presented at the School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.\nThe project has positive impact on students' approach of learning, personal growth and professional competence. Four students completed the overseas visit to US have achieved the intended objectives in understanding global nursing, participation in cross-cultural and professional learning, appreciation of different nursing practices in United States and development of cultural competence of care. Moreover, an online learning module was created from the learning resources collected and produced in the overseas visit, and it was incorporated into a mental health subject SN2704 which was well received by a majority of 111 students in semester 1 of 2017-2018 academic year. The online learning module has enriched students' learning experience from local to global mental health context and enhanced their cross-cultural and professional competence. The project has created a potential to enhance the internationalization of a mental health subject in the nursing curriculum and more collaboration with overseas institutions in student exchange and teaching.\nInternationalising the Student Learning Experience: Overseas visit programmes to Coventry University, UK for BSN & BSMHN students (PI: Dr YW Mak)\tCompleted\t\nLarge Equipment Fund for Teaching: CAE Healthcare HPS-010 Human Patient Simulator\nThe Large equipment fund attained for this project was for the purchase of the CAE Healthcare HPS 465 Human Patient Simulator (HPS) to replace the old model that has been used for over 10 years. Additional funding was received from the school of Nursing to renovate the laboratory with the new equipment installed. The laboratory was under renovation from May and over the summer and has recently been reopened in 2017-2018 academic year. This intensive care patient simulator care model is the only physiological based with pre-configured simulated clinical experiences to be used by students at the School of Nursing.\nTwenty clinical track staff and lecturers of nursing subjects from the school attended the training on the use of this simulator. Faculty member from Rehabilitation Sciences were also invited to join the training sessions. Both local and overseas training were completed in this year and the HPS was in full operation during the semester. All undergraduate students have the opportunity to use the HPS as part of their simulated clinical experiences. Inter-professional education was piloted with great success and received a Teaching and Learning Grant for the development of a new teaching module for students of allied health and nursing professions.\nThe simulated clinical experiences have enriched the students’ learning and were considered as one of the major learning and teaching strategies in the preparation of professional nurses. Students’ learning experiences are continued being facilitated with the adoption of the new HPS and case simulation.\nLarge Equipment Fund for Teaching: Stereoscopic Anatomy Visualizer (PI: Dr John Yuen)\tOn-going\neLearning and Blended Learning Development Project: An online mode of Pain & Symptoms Management (SN5112) leading to internationalised and interdisciplinary learning (PI: Dr Mimi Tse)\n10 video clips were developed to demonstrate multidisciplinary efforts in managing pain, these online video clips were well-received by students in HK and in US;\nConference presentaion, Tse, M.

  "text": "陈胡安琪教授 \n简历\nInspired by narrative as both a phenomenon and a research methodology, Angela has embarked on her own narrative journey from Canada to Hong Kong where she is now the Associate Professor/Associate Head of the pre-service education at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, School of Nursing. She was selected as one of the four distinguished nursing alumni abroad in 2005 from the Faculty of Nursing, University of Toronto, Canada. She has also served the role as the president for the Pi Iota Chapter, Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing in 2008. Her research focuses on the person/relation-centered care underpinned by caring/human science paradigm that has evolved into an emphasis on effective and caring communication in health care and interprofessional collaborative practice. Her work on communication studies in education and practice has enabled her to work with overseas and local colleagues to improve nursing practice and served as the former Associate Director of the International Research Centre for Communication in Healthcare. Her work on nursing education has also afforded her the opportunity to develop projects, with international collaborators, on the concept of internationalization at home for a new possibility of student exchange.\n学历\nBachelor of Science in Nursing, University of Toronto\nMaster of Arts, Central Michigan University\nDoctor of Philosophy, University of Toronto\n专业资格\nRegistered Nurse\nRegistered Nurse\n教学范围\nMy concepts of experience and education have an intricate tie to the work of John Dewey, one of the greatest educational theorists, that is on the notion about thinking is inquiry, inquiry is life and life is education. My ways of teaching is hence much inspired by Dewey’s work while drawing a balance in my understanding of the importance of students’ expected performance that translated into outcome-based education with criteria-focused assessments and the associated rubrics. Adopting the constructivist approach, I am an advocate for students’ active learning and experiential understanding. Given my post-graduate work in curriculum and education, I also came to appreciate teachers as learners and learners as teachers with my ongoing reflection upon how to better students’ learning through their perceived relevance and meaningfulness. In the students’ journey through their university education, there is a need for more time and space for students to think, in the forms of problem-solving, critical and creative thinking, asking questions and reflecting from their experience. As they reflect and learn from their experience, they will come to understand more about themselves, about others and their environment. To nurture the students as independent thinkers with openness, being mindful about their assumptions, biases and as interdependent team players with sensitivity, respect and integrity is part of what I believe. Making use of technology and an emphasis of intercultural learning in my teaching and learning is an area of my ongoing endeavors.\n研究兴趣\nCaring science in education and practice \nInterprofessional education and practice \nNarrative pedagogy \nNursing education \nPatient-centred care \nCaring practice in relation to time \nNursing delivery model \nTherapeutic communication \nCommunication in healthcare ",

He is an accomplished qualitative researcher with expertise in descriptive phenomenology.\n教学范围\nDr Christensen's experience and expertise in teaching the following subjects:\nCritical Care Nursing\nAdvanced Nursing Research (Qualitative)\nPractice Development\nDr Christensen's teaching philosophy is focused on enabling and empowering both under-graduate and post-graduate students to become effective caring empathic clinicians and researchers. His skill as a teacher and educator is enabling students to realise their potential and construct new experiences that have meaning for them in a wider context. This is especially true in nursing where some students are unable to integrate what they know with what they see. By making them responsible and take ownership for their learning allows them to grow professionally and personally. Moreover, he believes empowering learning allows students to challenge and be creative critical thinkers. Dr Christensen is opposed to the idea that knowledge wields power. He firmly believes that knowledge especially in nursing should be used to proactively promote patient well-being and person-centred care first and foremost and the ongoing professional development of nursing; in this regard he is particularly attracted to and consciously practices the pneumonic TEAM – ‘together everyone achieves more’ in the way he teaches, undertakes research and supports colleagues.\nDementia and delirium \nQualitative research ",
