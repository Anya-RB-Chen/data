  "text": "Vision Screening \nLearning through Providing Eye Care and Vision Health to the Community\n(Subject Code: SO2S01)\nSubject Introduction Nature of Service Activities Service Beneficiaries Vision Screening Request \nIn January 2014, the School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University introduced a new subject “Learning through Providing Eye Care and Vision Health to the Community” that is open to all PolyU students, with an annual intake quota of 360 students. The launch of this General University Requirements (GUR) service-learning subject aims to raise students’ awareness of health care issues and nurture their sense of social responsibility. Through the provision of community vision screenings and eye care activities, we facilitate students from different disciplines to apply what they have learned in the classroom and to work towards a common goal of blindness prevention in the community. \nThis subject is related to \"Vision Hong Kong\", an intraprofessional charity project of the School of Optometry developed in collaboration with the optometry profession and the optical industry to respond to vision care needs in our community.\nEye diseases and visual disorders span all age groups and contribute to major public health problems in our community. According to the World Health Organization estimates the number of blind people worldwide will double by 2020. The aim of this service learning subject is to engage Polytechnic University students across all disciplines to involve in direct activities to benefit identified under-privileged communities, with the hope that we can help in the prevention of global blindness. Through this introductory-level course, students will gain increased awareness of this major public health issue, learn to appreciate specific strategies in its prevention and control, and to provide active outreach services to help minimize this growing strain on our economic and health care systems.\nIn this subject, we aim to integrate community services with students’ learning opportunities. Students of other discipline will be given an opportunity to work in groups with optometry students and to organize and implement a vision screening project by themselves under the supervision of optometrists. By means of this subject, they can act as community service providers, as well as (care), work and communicate with various disciplines to bring together knowledge they have acquired during their university studies, and then share and apply their special interests with others. The project not only benefits service users, but also provides a very structured environment for students to gain experience working with a number of people in different levels of the community and to better understand societal needs, especially in this major public health concern of blindness prevention. This is in-line with PolyU’s motto “To learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind”.\nOver the years, SO and its Optometry students have collaborated with various non-governmental organizations and charitable bodies, and there is a continual stream of requests for our community services from past partnerships, including schools and nursing homes. Our target beneficiaries are people who have difficulty accessing vision and eye health care services, including but not limited to the elderly, schoolchildren (especially kindergarten and primary school students), new immigrants, low-income families, refugees, members of ethnic minorities, as well as those with physical or mental disabilities in Hong Kong, Mainland China and other overseas countries.",

  "text": "We always hear some elderlies say that they see things blurry. Does it mean that we would have decreased vision when we get older? Is the blurry vision normal?\nIf you find that you get tired easily or have blurry vision during reading, it is possible that you get presbyopia. Presbyopia is a normal condition when people get older. It often starts from forty years old. No matter you are myopic or hyperopic, you would finally have presbyopia. As long as you seek help from optometrist and fit a proper spectacle, the vision could be improved. \nIf you have difficulty with your distant vision, it could be caused by multiple reasons. Besides myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism, cataract or age-related macular degeneration (AMD) could also be the cause. Cataract is more common, and the majority of people older than sixty would have it, and it get worse with aging. The symptoms of cataract is not obvious at early stage, and the vision is not much affected, so no treatment is needed for early cataract. Whether cataract extraction is needed depends on the severity of the disease and the vision requirement of the patient. Thus, not every patient with cataract have to do the surgery. \nYou might have heard of AMD, so what is macula? Macular is located at the center of retina, and it is the place where the photoreceptors are most densely packed. Healthy macula gives us clear and sharp vision. If macula become degenerated, we would have decreased vision or see things distorted, and we could have difficulty with our daily activities such as reading, watching TV and driving. Since the symptoms of AMD are not obvious at early stage, many people think that AMD is a normal condition of degeneration and the treatment might be delayed. However, once the cells at macular region get injured, vision could be preminantly decreased. Thus, early diagnose and treatment are important to keep our eyes healthy. Besides aging, smoking and long-term exposure to sunlight are also important factors aggregate AMD. \nIn fact, many eye disease are closely related with aging, so please get alerted when you see things blurry. We should check our eye completely and annually at optometrist, and find out the true reason for the blur. With annual eye check, not only could we imporve our vision, but also we could have better outcome for the following treatment. \nMany elderlies regard blurry vision as a normal condition. Actually, as long as elderlies get familiar with soma eye-care tips, they could also have healthy eyes. \nThe most important thing to care for our eyes is to consult optometrist for comprehensive eye exam regularly. For long, many people think that eye check is only about cheking refraction. Actually, besides checking refraction, a comprehensive eye exam also include checking health of the eye. After the eye exam, not only eye diseases like cataract, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration could be diagnosed, but also retina diseases induced by hypertension or diabetes could be detected. As a result, annual eye exam is very important for elderlies. \nBesides regular eye check, eye care in our daily life is also very important. For example, elderlies should remember to wear proper sunglasses when going outside. A pair of proper sunglasses must have correct prescription to make the wearer see clearly, and should have good anti-UV function to protect the eyes from UV insult. \nIn addition, elderlies could use Asmler’s Chart to self-check if there’s macular degeneration. If the lines in the chart get blurry, distorted or even lost, a comprehensive eye exam should be conducted as soon as possible in order to have treatment in time. \nActually, health of the eye is closely related to the body’s health, good living habit could reduce the influence of systemic diseases to the eye. For example, stable blood pressure and blood glucose level are important to keep the eye healthy. As long as the elderlies take care of the eye, clear vision would be with you. Let’s start protecting our eyes from today!\nReading difficulty (or presbyopia) and white hair sneak in with increasing life experiences, and some people may feel a little annoyed by this in their early 40s. White hair can be dyed black, but how to solve the problem of presbyopia?\nWith the help of the latest manufacturing technology, progressive addition lenses (PAL) enable users to view at far distance and read at near clearly without the need to switch eyeglasses. PAL is a corrective lens that has multiple, line-free focal points or powers in a single lens. The distant vision is corrected when he/she looks straight with PAL. He/she needs to look down to use the lower portion of PAL for reading.\nBefore prescribing PAL, you must first understand your needs and working environment. People with different occupations and lifestyles have different visual needs, such as reading books or documents, computers work or playing Mahjong. Different types or brands of PALs could serve different purposes.\nIn addition, most of the Hong Kong people have prolonged use of computers, mobile devices and reading, thus they have a greater demand in intermediate and near vision. The optical zone for intermediate distance in conventional PALs is relatively smaller, compared to the ordinary reading glasses. Users may find difficulty in reading for a long time. Therefore, one might consider to prescribe a modified PAL that particularly for intermediate and near vision (so called office PAL). Office PALs have a larger optical zone for computer work and near task by shifting the optical zones for intermediate and near distance up.\nIn order to wear PALs comfortably, you must first understand the principle of PALs. There are different functions in different regions of PALs. To view the distant scene clearly, the wearer must look straight ahead while facing the target. On the other hand, your head can be tilted slightly forward with your eyes looking down when reading or looking at a near object with PALs.\nThe wearer might experience some discomfort or distortion if they look into the sides of lenses as the refractive powers on the peripheral part of the lens change gradually change. Therefore, it is advisable to turn their heads in order to view the peripheral objects.\nTo conclude, you should consult your optometrist before prescribing PALs. Don’t forget to adjust the frame frequently after prescription as your vision could be affected if the position of frame is not well fitted.\nPresbyopia is not an eye disease, and it cannot be prevented. It is a normal loss of near focusing ability that occurs with age. Most people begin to notice the effects of presbyopia sometime after age 40, and it will gradually increase with age. Presbyopia is caused by the gradual loss of elasticity of the crystalline lens in our eyes and the weakening of eye muscles, which make it difficult for us to focus on close-up objects. Early symptoms include eye fatigue or headache after reading, feeling uncertain in focus while reading or using a computer/mobile phone, the need to pull near objects further away when reading, the need to take off myopia glasses to read, and having better reading ability in a bright environment. \nCommon Misunderstandings (1) – I won’t have presbyopia if I have short-sightedness (myopia)?\nIn people with myopia, the crystalline lens will also harden with age, and the accommodation will weaken, so there will still be presbyopia. The spectacle lens that is used to correct myopia is called a concave lens, where the effect is the opposite of reading glasses (convex lens). So, when a myope takes off glasses when looking at near objects, the effect is similar to wearing a pair of reading glasses. For instance, a person with 2 diopters of myopia needs to wear -2.00 D lenses to correct distant vision. If his presbyopia happens to be 2 diopters (+2.00 D), he needs to wear (-2.00 D) + (+2.00 D) = 0.0 D when looking at near objects (plano lens). Others may seem to think that they can read without wearing reading glasses. In fact, their myopia and presbyopia exist at the same time.\nCommon Misunderstandings (2) - Will myopia decrease due to presbyopia?\nMyopia will not be reduced by presbyopia. For example, a person with 4 diopters of myopia needs to wear -4.00 D lenses to correct distant vision. If his presbyopia is 2 diopters (+2.00D), he needs to wear (-4.00 D) + (+2.00 D) = -2.0 D (2 diopters of myopia) for near. It can be seen that the myopic power for distance has not decreased, but when you look close, the presbyopic power offset part of the myopic power.\nCommon Misunderstandings (3) – Is far-sightedness (hyperopia) equal to presbyopia?\nHyperopia does not equal to presbyopia, the two have different causes. The cause of hyperopia is that the eyeball is too short, and the image of an object is focused behind the eyeball. The eye needs extra effort to adjust the image to focus on the retina. The cause of presbyopia is due to the loss of elasticity of the crystalline lens. For example, a person with 4 diopters of hyperopia needs to wear +4.00 D lenses to correct distant vision. If his presbyopia is 2 diopters (+2.00D), he needs to wear (+4.00 D)+ (+2.00 D) = +6.0 D (6 diopters of hyperopia) for near.\nCommon Misunderstandings (4) – Are over-the-counter reading glasses suitable for everyone?\nReady-made reading glasses may not be suitable for everyone. Few people have exactly the same refractive power in both eyes. However, the power of these ready-made reading glasses is usually the same on both sides, and there is no astigmatic correction in these glasses. If the image clarity for both eyes is unbalanced, the wearer may experience fatigue easily. In addition, the optical center distance of ready-made readers may not match the wearer's pupillary distance, and lenses with poor optical quality are prone to induce dizziness in wearers. More importantly, some people who experience blurred vision may casually buy ready-made readers to improve vision. As these lenses usually have a magnifying effect, they seem to improve vision a little. However, other causes of blurred vision such as cataract and macular diseases are not ruled out. Hence, it is highly recommended to have a thorough eye examination in case there is any vision problem.\nCommon Misunderstandings (5) – After wearing reading glasses, will my eyes deteriorate faster?\nWearing reading glasses does not affect the speed of presbyopia progression. Wearing appropriate reading spectacles in a timely manner can help reduce eye fatigue.\nWill presbyopia continue to progress?\nYour presbyopic power mainly depends on your reading distance and the fineness of your near work. For example, are you reading a book at 40 cm or using a desktop computer at 60 cm? Do you need to read small prints on medication bottles or small numbers on a printed spreadsheet? In general, when the presbyopic power reaches +2.50 D to +3.00 D, it will gradually stabilize. Overuse of the eyes, such as using computers, mobile phones and reading documents for a long time, reading in low light, as well as lack of rest will all contribute to the progression of presbyopia.\nPresbyopia management options -glasses\nSeek for professional help from an optometrist to prescribe a pair of glasses will help to solve the problem. \nSingle vision lens (reading glasses)\nAdvantages: the whole lens is for near vision, easy to adapt\nDisadvantages: It is often inconvenient to frequently change the glasses for far and near\nBifocal lens\nAdvantages: It has two lens powers so that you can see both near and far. The top portion of the lens is used for distance, while the bottom portion is used for seeing up close. It is easy to distinguish and find the positions for far or near vision.\nDisadvantages: 1. The dividing line for far and near is very obvious, making the appearance not attractive\n2. If the prescriptions of the right and left eyes differ a lot, you may experience ghosting or double vision\n3. There is a lack of intermediate vision. People with higher presbyopic powers may have more difficulties when looking at objects in the intermediate distance e.g. computers\nProgressive lens\nAdvantages: 1. No obvious dividing line on the lens, more attractive looking\n2. It gives a wider zone of clear vision, one does not need to frequently change the glasses for far and near \nDisadvantages: 1. More difficult to adapt\n2. If the prescriptions of the right and left eyes differ a lot, you may experience ghosting or double vision\n3. Higher expense\nPresbyopia management options -contact lenses\nMonovision\nThe visual system can suppress a central blurred image in one eye. With monovision, the dominant eye is corrected for far while the non-dominant eye is corrected for near. \nLimitations: There is a lack of intermediate vision and the depth perception (stereopsis) will be compromised\nBifocal contact lens\nWith a segmented bifocal contact lens, the near vision prescription is in the lower part of the lens, and the distance prescription is in the upper part of the lens. When you look straight, you will be using the far part. When you look down, the lens is held up by the lower eyelid and you will be using the near part.\nLimitations: There is a lack of intermediate vision, the movement of the lens may reduce comfort\nMultifocal contact lens\nMultifocal contact lenses are designed with a gradual transition between near and far They are similar to progressive eyeglasses. It can be with concentric or aspherical design.\nLimitations: Pupil size affects the visual performance, may be difficult to adapt, accompanied by glare or hazy vision\nPresbyopia management options - surgery\nLaser surgery\nEither with monovision, having a small amount of myopia left in both eyes, or to create a multi-focus cornea in the non-dominant eye\nLimitations: Irreversible, need to carefully consider the risks and side effects, may still need to wear presbyopic eyeglasses after surgery\nIntraocular lens (IOL) implant surgery\nMultifocal IOLs, accommodative IOLs or extended depth of focus IOLs\nLimitations: IOL implantation surgery without cataracts (clear lens exchange) requires careful consideration of the surgical risks and side effects\nCorneal Inlays\nCorneal inlay refers to a tiny device being implanted into the cornea of the non-dominant eye to improve near vision. There are two main types of corneal inlays, namely refractive corneal inlays and small aperture inlays. The design of refractive corneal inlays is similar to a multifocal contact lens, with different areas of the inlay giving different levels of magnifying power. This allows the eye to focus up close and far away. Small aperture inlays work like the aperture of a camera, changing how much light enters the eye. It increases the depth of focus and provides better sight at close range.\nLimitations: Effectively improve near vision, but contrast sensitivity may decrease, risks of glare, halos and difficulty seeing at night or reading in dim light.",

Our undergraduate students, are trained to become qualified practitioners with scientific knowledge and clinical expertise, and are favourably received by the industry and institutions across the globe. Our graduates are eligible for full registration in Part I of the Register of the Optometrists Board of Hong Kong and also eligible to sit for the Competency in Optometry Examination (COE) and Assessment of Competence in Ocular Therapeutics (ACOT) hosted by the Optometry Council of Australia and New Zealand. \nIn addition to providing quality teaching and professional training, our School has been striving for research excellence in myopia and ageing eye. We aspire to safeguard public eye health through basic research, prevention, diagnosis, control and treatments. With world-class research facilities and dedicated and competent faculty members, our School has made significant fundamental contributions to myopia research and control. We also research into a better mechanistic understanding of age-related ocular diseases in terms of diagnosis, prevention and treatment.Our research continues to thrive with impactful publications in top tier journals and continual success in bidding for competitive research grants such as the General Research Fund and Research Impact Fund from the Research Grants Council, the Health and Medical Research Fund from Food and Health Bureau, as well as the funding from local and overseas industries. We are poise to scale new heights in the areas of innovation and technology development. \nThe School operates an on-campus teaching clinic and two satellite clinics, where senior optometry students receive their clinical training and the public access to holistic eye care services. In addition to knowledge and expertise in Optometry, the School endeavours to give our students a wide range of experiences to prepare them for professional life. The School has been actively engaging in community vision-screenings and providing comprehensive eye examination to the general public. Our undergraduate curriculum has adopted a Service-Learning approach in which students can develop their critical thinking ability and apply knowledge into practice. The total number of beneficiaries under two Service-Learning subjects and the \"Vision of Love Mobile Eye Care Project\" is over 50,000 since 2014. These vision-screenings have saved sights by uncovering sight-threatening diseases in the community. They also provide students the opportunities to serve people from all walks of life and to grow into professional demeanour worthy of respect. \nLooking ahead, we will continue the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research through efforts in internationalisation and opportunities in the Greater Bay Area. The School will continue to foster strategic partnerships in mainland China as well as other countries for innovation and optometric development that can benefit our global community.\nI hope that you will join us and open up new paths for the future",

Exclusive access to an interactive 3D eye model, virtual labs, live sessions, and detailed instructor feedback on each course assignment is available for the verified track.\nMore Details\nLearners' Feedback\nVirtual Eye Clinic (vEyeC) \nThe Virtual Eye Clinic (vEyeC) uses conversational chatbots to respond as simulated patients. Students type questions or exam procedures, and the virtual patients respond with text, images, or videos. The tool allows students to practice conducting a case history, analysing clinical data, and formulating a diagnosis and management plan without a real patient.\nStudents' Feedback\nProcedural Video Library \nWe have produced over 105 videos demonstrating various clinical procedures, including contact lens fitting, optical dispensing and paediatric examination techniques. Students are able to preview and revise the videos for their courses online anytime. Here are some samples.\nSlit-lamp external ocular health examination\nThis video demonstrates the routine for doing slit-lamp external eye examination. It also highlights the eye problems you need to be aware of during the eye examination.\nWatch the Demo video \nVerification of progressive addition lenses\nThis video demonstrates the procedures for verifying the parameters and power of a pair of progressive addition lenses (PAL).\nWatch the Demo video \nOCT measurement\nThis video demonstrates how to do an OCT measurement. OCT is an instrument allowing for examination of different retinal structures which benefits various retinal diseases and glaucoma.\nWatch the Demo video \nOnline Laboratory \nApart from online clinical demonstration videos, video clips filmed from patient’s perspectives are being used in the online laboratory sessions to temporary replace face-to-face laboratory sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students are expected to watch these pre-recorded videos before attending the online synchronous laboratory sessions. During the online synchronous laboratory session, instructors would guide students to complete an online assignment through collective efforts and discussions in small groups. Here are some samples of the pre-recorded videos. \nOnline Low Vision Laboratory in Optometry Specialisms\nStudents learn how to calculate and prescribe suitable low vision aids/ adaptative technologies for visually impaired patients to improve their functional performance.\nWatch the Demo video \nHow to focus the telescope?\nStudents learn how to facilitate low vision patients to focus the telescope. \nLow vision hand-held magnifiers\nStudents learn how to facilitate low vision patients to use hand-held magnifiers.\n3D Eye Model Mobile App \nYou can install this 3D eye model, developed by the PolyU School of Optometry, into your iOS devices. This eye model features various views of the human eye. You can zoom in and out, hide or show a particular structure of the eye. You can even semi-transparent a specific eye structure and observe its relationship with other parts of the eye. It contains animated videos to show common eye diseases like cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, etc. This eye model is the perfect tool for studying ocular anatomy and physiology.\nMore Details\nDownload iOS version\nVirtual Reality Simulators \nVirtual Reality (VR) simulators are used to enrich the optometry clinical training programme at PolyU. The simulators provide highly realistic experience and immediate feedback for students honing their clinical skills before transitioning to seeing real patients.

However, their visual function and quality of life may be enhanced by using specially designed contact lenses.\nAfter a comprehensive eye examination, patients will be referred to our specialty contact lens clinic. The anterior ocular health of these patients will be further evaluated using advance technology such as corneal topography and anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The patients will be prescribed with custom-made specialty contact lenses according to the clinical findings and personal needs. \nWhat are the types and uses of Specialty Contact lens?\nThere are different types of specialty contact lenses including multi-focal soft or rigid gas permeable (RGP) corneal lens, special designed tinted lenses, prosthetic contact lens, specialty RGP corneal lens, and scleral lens.\nAll these lenses have different clinical applications. For example, specialty corneal or scleral lens can neutralize the irregularities of the corneal surface and correct the refractive errors. Special designed tinted lenses can help patients to reduce visual discomfort and improve cosmetic appearance. After the ocular health and lens fitting assessments, our optometrists will discuss with patients about the possible lens choices and fit them with suitable type of specialty contact lenses. \nUseful Links\nUseful Links ",

  "text": "Organiser\nSchool of Optometry\nSummary\nAbnormal blood vessel formation is the leading cause of blindness. The standard of care for ocular angiogenic diseases is dominated by inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, a substantial number of patients do not respond to the treatment or may develop resistance over time, which is, at least, partially due to the compensatory activation of alternative angiogenic pathways in response to anti-VEGF treatment. Using an untargeted Proteomics-based approach, our study reveals a significantly lower level of a secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) in the vitreous of PDR patients as compared to that in control patients. We then constructed a fusion protein containing the SFRP and Fc portion of IgG and demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect of SFRP-Fc on retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HREC) proliferation, viability, and tube formation as well as vessel outgrowth from the choroid, aortic ring, and metatarsal explants. SFRP-Fc is also able to prevent and reverse laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mice. We further demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of the SFRP (SFRPC) is responsible for its anti-angiogenic effect. Importantly, SFRPC-Fc synergistically inhibits CNV in combination with the anti-VEGF drug, Aflibercept. Mechanistically, SFRP inhibits angiogenesis by interacting with Caveolin, suppressing its phosphorylation, and altering the endocytosis of cell surface receptors. In summary, this study leads to the discovery of a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis, identified its functional domain, and established its mechanism of action.\nKeynote Speaker\nDr Xiaomeng Wang\nAssociate Professor, Centre for Vision Research, Duke-NUS Medical School\nDirector of Laboratory Translational Research, Singapore Eye Research Institute\nDr. Xiaomeng Wang is an Associate Professor at the Centre for Vison Research, Duke-NUS Medical School; Director of Laboratory Translational Research and Head of Ocular Therapeutics and Drug delivery at Singapore Eye Research Institute.

The aim is not to let go our hospitals and specialist care to make way for primary healthcare. Instead it is to build a system from the functional but fragmented primary care services complementary with our robust hospital and specialist system.\nAs a system, our primary healthcare will come with talents manning a structure of networked services in the community, which is placed under effective governance to provide services to the public, subsidized where appropriate by public fund.\nEffective tools are needed to put the bits and pieces into good order.

  "text": "Objective\nAdvocating vision screening and eye-health education and raising awareness of the need for eye care;\nIdentifying and following up eye diseases at an early stage for people in need;\nPromoting eyeglass recycling amongst PolyU students, staff, alumni and the public, thereby promoting awareness of the need for environmental protection and driving sustainability; and\nDemonstrating the University’s social responsibility.\nNature of Service Activities\nEye diseases and visual disorders span all age groups and contribute to major public health problems. The World Health Organization estimates that the number of blind people worldwide will double by 2020. The aim of this service-learning subject is to engage PolyU students across all disciplines in direct activities to benefit under-privileged communities, with the hope that we can help in the prevention of global blindness. Through this introductory-level course, students will gain increased awareness of a major public health issue, learn to appreciate specific strategies in its prevention and control, and provide active outreach services to help minimize this growing strain on our economic and health care systems.\nWe aim to integrate community service with student learning opportunities. Students of other disciplines will be given opportunities to work in groups with optometry students and organise and implement a vision-screening project by themselves under the supervision of optometrists. They will act as community service providers, apply interdisciplinary knowledge acquired through their university studies and share their special interests with others. The project will not only benefit service users, but will also provide a very structured environment for students to gain experience working with people at different socioeconomic levels and help them to better understand societal needs. This is in-line with PolyU’s motto “To learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind”.\nService Beneficiaries\nOver the years, our School and its optometry students have collaborated with various non-governmental organisations and charitable bodies, and we have received a continual stream of requests for community service from former partner, including schools and nursing homes. Our target beneficiaries are people who have difficulty accessing vision and eye health care services, including but not limited to the elderly, schoolchildren (especially kindergarten and primary school students), new immigrants, low-income families, members of ethnic minorities, and those with physical and mental disabilities in Hong Kong.\nSPONSOR\nThe Vision of Love Mobile Eye Care Project was established in 2017 with generous support from the Vison of Love Fund founded by Miss Cally Kwong. The aim is to advance the outreach eye care model via a mobile clinic that delivers primary and preventive eye-care services to needy people in the local community.",

  "text": "Scope of Practice for optometrists registered under Part 1 of the Optometrists Register \n(CAP359F: OPTOMETRISTS (REGISTRATION AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE) REGULATION)\nThe scope of practice of optometrists in the HKSAR is listed in the Supplementary Medical Professions Ordinance CAP359 as follows:\nSMP Ordinance: Schedule\nOptometrist:\nA person trained in the practice of-\n(a) testing vision;\n(b) prescribing optical appliances;\n(c) fitting optical appliances; or\n(d) supplying optical appliances on prescription. (Added 67 of 1985 s. 15)\nThe reason for the government adopting this definition in 1985 was explained as follows:\n“The purpose of the definition is to describe the work of the Optometry profession in sufficiently broad terms to ensure that it embraces all those engaged in optical work who ought to be registered. This definition does not purport to describe all the work an optometrist may do, but at the same time it does not prevent him from performing additional functions, such as the detection of ocular diseases. By the same token, restrictions may be imposed, through regulations, on the type of work which can be undertaken by different categories of optometrists.” SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND WELFARE, Legislative Council Minutes, Wednesday, 7 August 1985\nIn the 2008 consultation document on health care reform, the government defines optometrists and Optometry as follows:\nOptometrists\nHealth professionals trained to provide comprehensive eye and vision care, such as eyesight correction and diagnosis of common conditions related to the eyes or vision. They are not medical doctors but may refer patients to an ophthalmologist (who is a medical doctor specializes in eye care) for treatment when needed.\nOptometry\nA healthcare profession that is concerned with eyes and related structure,\nvision, and visual system.\nThe Code of Practice of the Optometrists Board of the HKSAR (1998) recognizes that training is key to the standard of care provided:\n6.1 It is recognized that while there are different levels of professional training it is not possible to set one standard of practice for all optometrists. It is, however, important for optometrists to realize that they are expected to provide a standard of care commensurate with the training they have received and with the part of the register on which their names appear.\nAdvice for PolyU-Optometry graduates registered under Part 1 of the Optometrists Register regarding the standard of care\nThe government’s position on Optometry over the past two decades has been consistent. Fully educated and qualified optometrists are expected to practice to a standard which matches the training they have received. This expectation is logical since formal Optometry education is mostly paid for by the government at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The Code of Practice of the Optometrists Board of the HKSAR is more explicit about this expectation.\nThe School of Optometry provides training, education and assessments to ensure that its graduates possess competencies to conduct primary eye care examinations including, but not limited to, detecting and assessing visual and ocular problems and managing conditions of the eye and visual system.\nFor PolyU Optometry graduates up to 2008, the exit competencies are consistent with Category 3 Ocular Diagnostic Services (ODx) as defined by the World Council of Optometry’s Global Competency-Based Model of Scope of Practice in Optometry. For students admitted from 2005, (i.e. graduating class of 2009 and onwards), the expected exit competencies would be consistent with Category 4 Ocular Therapeutic Services (OTx).\nWithin the constraints of the Medical Registration Ordinance CAP 161 Sect 32, these competencies define the standard of care expected of you.",

  "text": "PolyU Scholars Hub \nProf. Henry CHAN Ho-lung\nProfessor \nProf. Henry CHAN Ho-lung (陳浩龍) currently is a Professor in the School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He is also an Honorary Associate Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology, The University of Hong Kong.\nHJ504 \n+852 2766 7937 \nhenryhl.chan@polyu.edu.hk \nProf. Chan's main research area is visual electroretinogram (ERG). He specializes in techniques and experimental planning/setting for the study of visual electrophysiology. \nBiography\nProf. Henry Ho-lung CHAN (陳浩龍) completed his undergraduate training in Optometry in The Hong Kong Polytechnic and obtained his PhD in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in the area of clinical electrophysiology in vision. His current position is Professor in the School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He also obtained his fellowship of American Academy of Optometry (FAAO). He is currently the Honorary Associate Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology, The University of Hong Kong. \nResearch Overview\nIn 2006, he developed a new paradigm – modified global flash multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) –for early glaucoma diagnosis. This new method has over 90% of sensitivity and specificity for differentiating eyes with glaucoma from normal eyes. This special measurement has been proved to detect the glaucomatous changes at least 4 years before detected by the current clinical tests. \nOver the same period, he used the mfERG to investigate the myopia eye. The central inner retinal activities obtained using a specific multifocal ERG measurement is significantly correlated with later myopia progression in children. It is a potential reference for juvenile myopia development.\nRecently, he also worked on the area of the environmental influence in myopia progression. It is a new area to explore the mechanism of myopia development. Moreover, he also focuses on the treatment of eye diseases using Lycium Barbarum (LB) which is a commonly used TCM. One of his studies showed that a 12-month LB treatment was able to preserve vision and retinal structure in Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patients. \nEducation and Academic Qualifications\nAssociate Professor, School of Optometry, PolyU (2005 – present)\nAssistant Professor, Department of Optometry and Radiography, PolyU (1999-2005)\nDemonstrator, Department of Optometry and Radiography, PolyU (1997-1999)\nHonorary Associate Professor, Department of Ophthalmology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong University (2007 – present)\nHonorary Research Fellow, School of Life & Health Sciences, Aston University, UK (2016 – 2018)\nHonorary Associate Professor, School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong University (2015 – 2016)\nHonorary Associate Professor, Department of Anatomy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong University (2005 – 2015)\nHonorary Assistant Professor, Department of Anatomy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong University (2003 – 2005)\nVisiting Optometrist, Department of Ophthalmology, Queen Mary Hospital (2007 – 2009)\nAdjunct Clinical Associate Professor of Optometry, School of Optometry, Indiana University, US (2007 – 2009)\nMember of Education Committee for the Optometrists Board in Hong Kong (Nov 2008 – Oct 2014)\nDirector of The Hong Kong Federation of Societies for Prevention of Blindness (Jan 2013 – Dec 2014; Jan 2017 – present)\nVice-president of The Hong Kong Society of Professional Optometrists (Chairman of the Professional Development Committee) (2003 – 2004)\nRegistered Optometrist (Part I) in Hong Kong (1996 – present)\nCredentialed Optometrist and overseas examiner, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of New Zealand (2006-2008) \nMember of Hong Kong Society of Professional Optometrists (1991 – present)\nMember of The International Society of Clinical Electrophysiology for Vision (ISCEV) (2000 – present)\nProfessional Qualifications\nFellow of the American Academy of Optometry\nTeaching Area\nResearch Interests\nVisual electrophysiology (both in human and animal studies, basic and clinical research) \nVisual Neuroscience and psychophysics (basic and clinical research) \nGlaucoma research \nRetinal physiology and diseases \nMyopia research \nRetinitis pigmentosa research \nDiabetic retinopathy research \nAge-related maculopathy research \nResearch Output\nIn this exploratory analysis of 2 cohort studies, the intervention using defocus incorporated multiple segments (DIMS) lens was significantly associated with slower myopia progression and axial elongation during COVID-19 lockdown by 46% and 34%, respectively, when compared with regular single vision lens. Optical defocus intervention was significantly associated with slower myopia progression in schoolchildren, which was exaggerated during the COVID-19 lockdown. \nThis study demonstrated that the characteristics of near work scene profile (e.g. defocus dispersion, etc.) and home size strongly influence further myopia progression. In addition, from my unpublished data, myopia progression in an animal model was found to be dependent on the composition of spatial stimuli. All these findings could allow the future development of a new measure to provide appropriate spatial details in the environment \nGlaucoma is an irreversible blinding disease that causes compartmentalized degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells. As glaucoma is a multifactorial disease, current standard treatments depend largely on altering a single risk factor, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Lowering the IOP, remains the mainstay of current standard clinical protocol. However, a proportion of glaucoma sufferers continued to deteriorate despite well-controlled IOP. To target this problem, complementary and alternative medicines, e.g. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are widely considered to be applied on top of the current standard IOP lowering treatments. Pretreatment with LBP, as a kind of TCM with a strong neuroprotective effect, had been reported to protect against retinal damage in animal glaucoma models. However, there was no published evidence of post-treatment effect of LBP in glaucoma. This study successfully demonstrated the therapeutical effect of LBP under post-treatment condition to delay both functional and structural deterioration in both acute and chronic glaucoma animal models. The results will help in developing the next generation of glaucoma drugs in the future. \nThis study aimed to evaluate the drug treatment effect of atropine in myopia control on the children with different predicted rates of myopia progression. The results showed that atropine gives very different effects on children with different predicted myopia progression rates. It is a very important finding which will help to decide the customized clinical treatment protocol for an individual child. \nAbnormal neural rewiring in the mutated retinitis pigmentosa (RP) retina is solid evidence of the neural network re-construction. My research findings found an unbalanced activities of ON- and OFF-pathways which were likely to cause abnormal feedback from the inner retina and finally modify and trigger an overall weak electro-retinal response from the mutated retina This new evidence introduced a new concept of retinal neuroplasticity and provides an alternative direction for treatment. This study was to investigate the effectiveness of Lycium Barbarum supplement to delay retinal degeneration in RP patients. Lycium Barbarum was found to have strong neuroprotective effects which can reduce the oxidative stress in the retina and could help delay or minimize degeneration of retinal cells in RP. A local TCM company has started to produce this supplement for the market. \nMyopia (short-sightedness) is caused by visual-guided ocular growth. The retinal electrophysiology in a myopic child differs from that of a myopic adult. It is likely related to the myopic progression. In this study.the central inner retinal activities obtained by the specific multifocal ERG paradigm was significantly correlated with later myopia progression. This suggested that subclinical reduction of the central inner retinal function in young children could be a myopigenic factor and it might be a potential reference marker for juvenile myopia development. \nThis study first showed that the human retina can respond to different signs of defocus with various magnitudes in terms of electrophysiology. It is a novel finding in humans, since only animal results had been previously reported. I also determined that the human retina had different responses to various spatial stimulations under different levels of optical defocus. Visual stimuli are composed of various spatial details. If detection of defocus is spatially tuned, a particular range of spatial frequencies may act as regulators for eyeball growth in response to defocus. Hence, manipulating the spatial details in the environment may be another important factor in retarding myopia progression. \nThis study aimed to develop a new method by application of the concept of temporal visual function, rather than spatial visual function, bypassing the detriment of ocular media (e.g. Cataract) to measure retinal activities. This was a novel approach in clinical examination, and it will benefit the fields of both optometry and ophthalmology. \nThis study was to apply multifocal ERG to investigate glaucomatous lesions in the human retina. A new visual electrophysiological examination method was developed to overcome the traditional problems to improve the diagnostic effectiveness for glaucoma detection. The sensitivity and the specificity of this new technique are both more than 90%. Further study showed that this technique can detect the early manifestations of glaucomatous damage at least 4 years earlier than all the current clinical glaucoma assessments. \nChan HHL, Lam HI, Choi KY, Li SZ, Lakshmanan Y, Yu WY, Chang RCC, Lai J, So KF.

Prof. He will create a new platform to facilitate academic-industrial collaboration in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, which is dedicated to developing and translating new treatments and novel ways of delivering eye care into clinical practice, in particular focusing on functional eye diseases and artificial intelligence. Prof. He is actively recruiting postdoc fellows, PhD/Master students, and visiting fellows for his ongoing research projects.\n“Hong Kong is a unique place where East meets West. The Greater Bay area is the largest and most populated urban area and is among the four largest bay areas in the world. Optometry is unique in the way that it focuses more on the functioning of our human eyes - myopia, presbyopia, ocular fatigue, dry eye and other conditions, although, these problems will not lead to severe visual impairment or blindness immediately, but do bring patients many functional problems that currently are largely ignored by ‘mainstream medicine’. To solve these problems, we need to think about new ways to do our science, new ways to work with industrial partners, new ways to treat the problems, and further translate them into products for clinical benefit. We encourage the most audacious and multi-disciplinary minds to join us to make a difference together”.\nEducation and Academic Qualifications\nDoctor of Philosophy, University College London, UK\nDoctor of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, China\nMaster of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, USA\nBachelor of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences, China\nProfessional Qualifications\nOphthalmologist, Ministry of Health, China\nSpecialist in Ophthalmology, Eminent Fellow, Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists\nResearch Interests\nMyopia \nPresbyopia \nEye Fatigue \nArtificial Intelligence \nInnovation \nIndustry-research Collaboration \nResearch Output\nHe M*., Xiang F., Zeng Y., Mai J., Chen Q., Zhang J., Smith W., Rose K., Morgan I.

More interestingly, it was determined that upregulating autophagy with trehalose, a natural disaccharide, was protective against RPE oxidative damage, which is a crucial factor in AMD pathophysiology. These findings have been published in peer-reviewed journals, including Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity and the International Journal of Molecular Sciences.

One of the most common features of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is capillary occlusion. During occlusion, ischemia and hypoxia could drive the microenvironment into a pro-inflammatory state. Using a mice model of type 1 diabetic induced streptozotozin, this study attempts to administer the tested drugs such as aspirin directly into the eye through intravitreal injection in order to prevent the progression of DR. In addition, visual optokinetic response and intracellular labelling will be used to determine the efficacy of the treatment by observing visual acuity and alpha ganglion cell morphology, respectively.

The disparity in the two retinal images may deteriorate or inhibit binocular function including fusion, fusional reserve and stereopsis. It is common to prescribe partial refractive correction to restore comfortable binocular vison. However, there is no specific guidelines for the optimal refractive correction.

However, many of these clinical procedures routinely used to diagnose and monitor DED are largely unrepeatable and sometimes show a weak correlation between the clinical findings and subjective symptoms. Therefore, more reliable and objective methods to aid the diagnosis of dry eye disease are needed.\nMy study would like to comprehensively investigate the tear composition of DED patients using high resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approach. Unlike comparing purely clinical findings and subjective responses, molecular changes in the tear fluid in response to different severity of DED could be measured, monitored, and evaluated more objectively. By correlating the tear composition changes and the patient’s ocular signs and symptoms, our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the DED may be better explored for developing effective treatment . More targeted clinical management can be prescribed to help restore the patient’s tear film homeostasis, and eventually improving their ocular health conditions.",

Hong Kong also reported a high prevalence of myopia among schoolchildren, reaching 70% by 17 years of age. Given that the rate of myopia progression is usually highest among schoolchildren, this is the key period to implement myopia control to slow down the progression such that the ocular complications that occur in adulthood may be prevented.\nA number of treatments have been developed and proven to be effective in controlling the progression of myopia. However, the decision to move forward with treatment is usually determined by the parents and influenced by many different factors. Understanding these factors and the parent’s willingness-to-pay for myopia control treatment is particularly important. From these information, cost-effectiveness model can be developed to examine the efficiency and equity of hypothetical programmes of myopia control.\nThis study will involve an interdisciplinary research approach which aims to synthesize the parental preferences data with the economic evaluation and information on the likely impact on specific population groups e.g. by socioeconomic status, to explore the trade-off between equity and efficiency for myopia control treatment. This can help to produce more accurate and comprehensive information to guide future strategies for myopia control.",

  "text": "Dr Allen CHEONG\nPredicting navigation patterns of visually impaired patients based on machine learning and the applications in computer-aided navigation \nGood orientation, navigation and wayfinding skills are important for independent travel. Unfortunately, these skills deteriorate as we age or become disabled, reducing older people’s mobility and community engagement. Because of reduced visual input due to vision loss, low vision patients may have difficulties to acquire accurate navigation and positioning efficiently, reducing their ability to travel independently. Hence, they have to rely on their caregivers or companions to travel, reducing their independency and physical activities. \nIn recent decades, with significant increases in computing power and rapid advances in artificial intelligence technology, key technologies such as route navigation and obstacle avoidance have been available to assist people’s navigation.\nCurrent navigation aids have limitations for providing reliable and efficient recognition and detection, which cannot fully meet the travel requirements of the visually impaired in terms of experience, practicality, interactivity and safety. Hence, patients’ independent travel remains very difficult, which seriously affecting their quality of life.\nPrior to designing a more user-friendly and reliable navigation aid, it is important to understand the navigation behavior adopted by visually impaired patients. For example, how low vision patients acquire their navigation positioning and reliable information at different scenarios during navigation. \nDue to the wide range of vision loss (from very mild to very severe low vision), patients may establish different navigation behavior and motor skills, which might be very different from their sighted peers. Their navigation strategies might be varied dependings on the environments. To analyze such large amount of behavior data, we shall use machine learning by simulating and building datasets for different scenarios (indoor, outdoor, daytime, nighttime), different people (congenital/ acquired, children/ adolescents/ middle-aged/old) and walking styles (speed, step length, up/down, arc). This database will provide more concrete information about common navigation modes adopted by patients. Adding personalized navigation mode applications, a more customized computer-aided algorithm will be developed which can predict walking patterns and modes for the visually impaired. This can truly help the visually impaired patients solve their access problems and minimize the machinization of previous assistive devices.",

It was predicted that half of the world population will be having myopia and 10% with high myopia by the year 2050. The World Health Organization (WHO) also reported that earlier onset of myopia is being observed in the society.\nMost recently, the DIMS lens has gained significant attention among researchers and ophthalmic practitioners as a new myopia control treatment option, following the successful results on children aged between 8 to 13 years old. However, considering the current trend of earlier onset of myopia, there is still lack of evidence on how well DIMS spectacle lenses could work in the younger myopes? Based on a previous study, children at the age of 6 who have less than +0.75D of hyperopia are at increased risk for developing myopia. In the meantime, the younger age of myopia onset is contributing to faster myopic progression which eventually lead to higher myopia in the adulthood. Hence, this project aims to investigate the myopia control effect of DIMS spectacle lens in younger children with very mild myopia.",

The laboratory and clinical investigations of this disease in Asian populations, and especially in Chinese people, are needed.\nIn this project, we try to have a better understanding and observation in development of demyelinating optic neuritis based on the novel rodent models, and monitor the longitudinal structural changes in axonal injury in demyelinating optic neuritis using optical coherence tomography and electrophysiological techniques. This study will provide an ideal platform for follow-up studies on the characteristics, pathogenesis and new therapeutic development in relation to optic neuritis.",

These proteins are constitutively expressed in myeloid-derived cells including neutrophils and monocytes and are induced in macrophages. Actually, they have complicated phenotypes that may suggest their different roles in different kinds of pathologic processes. For example, S100A8/A9 complex, the most common existent heterodimer, known as calprotectin, can suppress acute inflammation and has antimicrobial activities. \nDry eye disease (DED), defined by the Tear Film and Ocular Society (TFOS) in the Dry Eye Workshop II (DEWS II) report, is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface defined by the disruption of homeostasis of the tear film. The ocular signs accompanying DED are tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities. DED patients have some symptoms such as dryness, itching, redness, visual disturbance, and ocular fatigue. All these uncomfortable ocular problems can considerably affect individuals’ daily life and work. In some severe cases, it can even instigate mood alterations and depression. Currently, there has been increasing research on developing effective and safe ocular drugs for the treatment of dry eye disease. \nStudies focused on the identification of tear biomarkers of ocular surface diseases have shown that S100A8 and S100A9 proteins have important roles in inflammatory and immune processes. Hence, we aim to investigate the impact of S100A8/A9 phenotypes on the pathologic process in dry eye disease. Based on our findings, we will choose the inhibitors of these phenotypes to investigate the specific treatment of dry eye disease.",

The various forms of refractive error are myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. In the Asian Chinese population, the prevalence of myopia is rapidly increasing, affecting over 80% of the young adult population. However, until now, the mechanism for refractive error development is still not well understood. Recent studies have indicated that not only the fovea, where the photoreceptor cells are densely packed, but the peripheral retina also contributes to refractive error development and eye growth. Because off-axis astigmatism, an inherent optical aberration of the eye, dominates in the peripheral visual fields, we hypothesize a feedback loop that uses off-axis astigmatism as a visual cue to control eye growth. This study will employ an experimental approach using the chick model to investigate the effect of off-axis astigmatism on refractive error development.",

New POS is produced on a daily basis to replace its distal ends containing harmful oxidant products created from visual phototransduction. Central to this digestion process are the TAM receptors – a group of three receptor tyrosine kinases that are responsible in identifying apoptotic markers on the POS apical villi and initiating the phagocytic digestion. It is well-established that accumulation of these POS from gene knockout of TAM results in retinal degeneration and eventual loss of vision as seen in retinal degenerative animal models such as RCS rats. However, it is still unclear how the natural process of aging affects the expression patterns of TAM and their associated signalling pathways. My research focuses on providing a deeper understanding of how TAM exerts its role in the RPE cell and molecular level, and to uncover the effects of aging on TAM and their associated pathways.

These damages are currently irreversible and there is no effective therapeutic approach to slow down the degenerative process of RP.

Apart from acquiring knowledge about ocular health in class, with the guidance of supervisors, students also performed eye examinations and managed eye diseases during clinical placements. The School regularly arranged local and overseas vision screenings for different target groups, for example, people with special needs, elderlies and children. By participating in these activities and interacting with people from different backgrounds, I have learned that caring and patience are essential qualities to possess as an optometrist. My journey at PolyU has been fulfilling; I am glad that my occupation allows me to contribute to the community and help those in need continually.\nChan Hiu-Tung Toby\nBSc (Hons) in Optometry (Class of 2021)\nWe might once regard University as the destination, but rather, it is another new start. The Optometry Programme equipped us for the future by providing excellent opportunities to explore various career options. Besides gaining the knowledge and skillsets to be optometrists, we also developed a thorough understanding of the optometric field through clinical placements, attachments, overseas exchanges, and studentship programmes. With all of these, we were confident to take our best-suited paths after graduation. The delightful experience as a student assistant under the Summer Research Studentship has motivated me to enter the academic world as a research postgraduate. I am proud to be an optometrist and a junior vision researcher.\nKen Chan Kin-ho\nBSc (Hons) in Optometry (Class of 2020)\nPolyU’s 5-year Optometry programme not only gave us in-depth knowledge about eye structures and diseases, but also equipped us as competent eye care service professionals. Throughout our studies and clinical placements, supervisors provided generous support in training us to be independent practitioners. Studying optometry also gave me a sense of achievement and commitment to serving others. Today, I am able to identify, diagnose and treat eye problems in patients and possibly help them see better with the appropriate corrective measures.\nKatherine So Hiu-yan\nBSc (Hons) in Optometry (Class of 2017)\nThe Optometry programme not only shaped us to become professional and competent, but also focused on our social responsibility. Participating in local and overseas vision screenings allowed me to connect to the community and the world by applying what I had learnt in the classroom to help people in need. Volunteering to conduct vision screenings in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Cambodia and Vietnam was remarkably rewarding. We performed different screening tests and prescribed glasses for patients.

As the population ages in Hong Kong, more and more people are suffering from age-related eye diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinal degeneration and cataract. The school is committed to conducting research in eye disease management and ophthalmic medical equipment, so as to better monitor structural and functional changes in specific regions in the eyeball, safeguarding the vision and eye health of our community.\nGround-Breaking Glaucoma Research, Diagnostics & Treatments",

  "text": "Children Vision \nVision develops rapidly during childhood, but a delay or disruption of the developmental process results in various visual and cognitive functional deficits, including visual acuity, stereopsis, and reading and writing skills. Research into Children's Vision aims to investigate the mechanism of visual function development and enhance affected children's visual and cognitive performance by applying cutting-edge technology. \nDiabetic Retinopathy \nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is a progressive eye disease that impacts the retinal microvasculature. New insights into the pathophysiology of DR could improve metabolic control. Structure-function analyses help reveal further details of DR development. Intraocular drug therapy can provide improved visual outcomes. DR will continue to be an important area of research for patients and their families.\nDry Eye \nDry eye is a complex condition with multiple contributing factors. Our clinical research projects aim to utilize the latest diagnostic tools to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel dry eye treatments. We also employ animal models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. Our goal is to enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by this challenging condition, particularly in the Asian population. \nGlaucoma & Ocular Dynamic \nGlaucoma is the leading global cause of irreversible blindness. There is a lack of effective antiglaucoma drugs. Recently, nanomedicines and nanomedicine-based novel strategies for the pharmacotherapy of glaucoma have become alternatives to conventional ophthalmic formulations due to several advantages, such as improved barrier permeability. \nMyopia \nMyopia research aims to understand risk factors, mechanisms, and develop effective interventions to slow or halt its progression. Recent studies show potential links between near work activities, outdoor time, and myopia onset, with promising results from the specific light-based and contact lens/spectacle interventions. Further research could lead to personalized approaches for myopia control and reduced global prevalence of myopia-related eye complications.\nNeuroprotection & Functional Restoration \nThe retina is responsible for vision and contributes the major sensory input to the brain. Novel therapeutic targets based on neuronal protection, repair, or regeneration are necessary to prevent blindness from retinal degenerative diseases. Our researchers are, therefore, exploring bench-to-bedside neuroprotective strategies, including gene therapy, mitochondrial transplantation, use of small molecules, and epigenetic modifications, to tackle the early pathophysiological changes and delay retinal degeneration. In addition the possibility of repair of injured neurons, using stem cell-based therapy, holds promise in restoring vision to persons who have already lost their sight.\nNeuroscience \nThe retina – a window of the central nervous system – is a unique and valuable link between visual science and neuroscience. Our studies combine anatomy, biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, stem cell biology, pharmacology, physiology, genetics, and \"omics\", as well as computational, behavioural and cognitive neuroscience to advance the understanding and, potentially, the novel treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.\nOcular Proteomics \nOcular proteomics has contributed dramatically to identifying disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. Single‐cell spatial proteomics aims to depict the underlying mechanisms of how the products of many genes interact to produce a cellular phenotype. In addition, developing a multi-omics approach and artificial intelligence-based multi-omics bioinformatics will allow synergy of the strengths of each type of 'omics data and assist in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis and causality in molecular events. Our ultimate goal is to make contributions to precision medicine.\nOphthalmic Instrumentation \nOphthalmic instrumentation is a rapidly evolving field, focusing on developing advanced and innovative technologies for vision research. Recent advancements include high-resolution imaging devices, wearable sensors for monitoring eye health, and computer-aided diagnosis systems. These innovations aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in eye care.\nPresbyopia \nMore than 1.8 billion presbyopes rely on complex multifocal eyeglass designs to see at all distances. However, there is a research gap about how and to what extent the artificial design of these lenses can capitalize on and influence patients’ neural processes to yield better vision. To tackle this question, our research seeks to evaluate and create new design strategies using optical imaging and the remodelling of neural efficiency.\nPublic Health \nVision public health research helps in the understanding of conditions related to the eye on a societal level and beyond, including, but not limited to, eye diseases, refractive errors, and eye-care service module preferences. Better understanding could aid policymakers in adapting strategies to tackle the needs of society. \nRetinitis Pigmentosa \nRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the collective term of a group of hereditary diseases affecting the retina. These lead to loss of night and peripheral vision, eventually resulting in severe vision loss. We are exploring the underlying mechanisms of photoreceptor death and working on the development of protection, rescue and exploring the therapeutic potential of multi-targets in RP.\nTraditional Chinese Medicine \nThe eye is unique in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) because of its diagnostic tool, five-wheel pattern differentiation, allows diagnosis of eye disorders as it is a syndrome differentiation system. The principle of TCM is to tonify and nourish the liver and kidney and to enrich the yin. The mechanisms of TCM, which include anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, immunomodulation, and anti-hyperglycaemic, may mediate the beneficial activities of TCMs in the eye.\nVision Rehabilitation \nVisual rehabilitation employs manipulations of environmental stimulation to improve low visionTechnological advances providing more control over this stimulation open possibilities for sharper images, which poses the difficult, but exciting question of how, by re-configuring the environment, can brain processes be enhanced and the brain trained to \"see\" better. With this objective, our laboratory seeks to explore the link between the eye and the brain through new modalities of visual stimulation, including dynamic optical manipulation of retinal images.",

  "text": "Myopia Epidemic in Hong Kong and South East Asia\nShortsightedness or myopia has assumed epidemic proportions in South East Asia over the past few decades. It is the most prevalent refractive error in Hong Kong. The average prevalence of myopia in Hong Kong people born before 1950 is about 30 % whereas it is about 70% people born between 1950 and 1980. Hong Kong Chinese students have a higher prevalence of myopia regardless of whether they attend in local or international schools when compared with other ethnic groups.\nThe severity of myopia is also escalating and it is common to find young adults with over 5D of myopia in Hong Kong. Similar figures have been reported in other Asian regions including Singapore, Taiwan and Southern China. Alarmingly, more than 80% of the entire adult population will be myopic within the next 30 years. In addition to the cost of myopic refractive correction, there are myopia-related ocular complications which have raised significant health concerns. High myopia is frequently associated with retinal degeneration, peripheral retinal breaks and glaucoma. These conditions may lead to permanent visual loss and blindness.\nThere is no clinically accepted method in controlling myopic growth at present. The goal of our myopia research is to find ways to retard and, one day, can cure myopia.\nMyopia Research in PolyU\nThe scale of the myopia problem in Hong Kong was revealed by a number of early epidemiological studies by our research team in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1997, the PolyU created the Centre for Myopia Research as one of the Areas of Strategic Development (ASD). With ASD funding, the scope of work has greatly expanded from epidemiological studies to in-depth inquiry into the basic biological mechanisms of myopia. Our Centre is now conducting clinical, genomic and proteomic research using a multi-disciplinary approach, pulling in expertise from all areas of clinical and basic science. In 2007, the Centre for Myopia Research was designated as an Area of Strength of the PolyU. \nOrthokeratology (Ortho-k) in Hong Kong\nOvernight ortho-k is a treatment for correcting myopia by altering the corneal shape with specially designed, high oxygen permeability rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Patients wear the lenses when they go to sleep and remove them in the morning. When the treatment is completed and stabilized, they will be able to see clearly without the use of any other optical aids in the daytime. The effect is temporary and requires lens wear usually on a nightly basis. In Hong Kong, the majority of ortho-k patients are children wearing their lenses to slow the progression of myopia.\nIn 2000, our research team conducted a pilot study on ortho-k for myopic control - the LORIC study. The results of the LORIC have attracted extensive attention worldwide as it is the first study reporting the potential use of ortho-k in slowing the progression of myopia in children. Our objective is to promote a safe and effective alternative to the general public, especially to children, for correcting refractive errors and slowing the increase in myopia. The ultimate goal is to prevent the development of high myopia in the population thereby reducing vision loss in our community.\nOur current research studies address the factors governing the success of ortho-k and the corneal responses to these specially designed contact lenses. We also want to identify the characteristics of good candidates for ortho-k and to follow the long-term refractive and ocular changes of these patients.\nProteomic Analysis of Myopia Development in the Animal Model\nProteomics is the study of cellular proteins in a high-throughput manner where thousands of proteins can be profiled, quantified and identified very quickly. The procedure involves a sensitive separation technique that can resolve many cellular proteins simultaneously. It also makes use of the accuracy of mass spectrometry (MS) in quantifying the mass of ionized peptides after a protein is fragmented. Unknown proteins can even be fragmented in such a way that de novo protein sequencing can be carried out. One of the major aims in proteomic research is to understand the biochemical signals that drive myopic growth using animal models. We have studied chick retina and profiled a comprehensive-proteome. Since myopia is believed to be a local process that involves signal transduction within the eye, i.e. from the retina to the sclera, we have attempted to trace these signals during myopia development. \nMyopia Genomics Study\nThe myopia genomics study aims to identify human genes that may predispose people to myopia. In turn, this helps to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying myopia development, and devise new strategies to delay the onset or even prevent the development of myopia in susceptible individuals.\nOur research team employs a variety of strategies to identify myopia genes. In terms of study subjects, we recruit families with severely myopic children, and unrelated individuals who are either severely myopic or without myopia. In terms of the study approach, we study individual candidate genes selected based on putative biological functions and related information, and also systematically screen the whole human genome with high-throughput genotyping technologies. We have already identified a number of myopia genes and will continue our efforts to identify more myopia genes and delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying myopia.\nPathophysiology of Myopia Development\nIt has been demonstrated that retinal neurons are able to differentiate between different types of optical defocus, and thereby initiating compensatory changes in ocular growth. In response to the artificially-induced dioptric blur, it has been shown that ocular growth is regulated by local growth signals or mediators generated in the retina. Subsequently, these signals transfer from the neural retina across the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to the targets including choroid and sclera. Recent evidence has shown that myopic and hyperopic defocuses induce thinning and thickening of choroid, respectively. The change in choroidal thickness is one approach to study the major focus of studying the development of refractive errors and myopia. However, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear and it may be mediated by the change in fluid transport across the RPE. We have been focused on the contribution of ion and fluid secretion across the RPE in lens deprived eyes using chick as a model.\nAstigmatism\nIn addition to myopia, astigmatism is also a very common refractive error that affects visual quality at all ages. Although it is frequently associated with short- and long-sightednesses, ageing eyes, and eye diseases, the cause of astigmatism is not fully understood. The main research interest is to study the mechanism underlying astigmatism in response to the changes in the visual environment. It is hoped that these studies will shed light on the clinical management of astigmatic errors.",

  "text": "Underprivileged Population: Based on the belief that the benefit of controlling myopia using DIMS lenses should not be restricted by one’s socioeconomic status, the Hong Kong Innovation Foundation (HKIF) teamed up with SO to launch a two-year “The Hong Kong Polytechnic University-HKIF Children Eye Care Project” in 2019 [S1]. The objective is to help 200 underprivileged families to prevent the development of myopia at an early age. The prevention of myopia at an early age can significantly reduce the risk of high myopia at later ages. The development of ocular complications due to high myopia becomes a long-term financial and eye health burden to the underprivileged population. The Project received positive feedback from the participants and their parents [S2]. Excerpts (translated) of the feedback include, “the project provided the opportunity to use this novel myopia control device”, “it enhanced eye health awareness and the understanding to eyewear care”, and “it facilitated the understanding of the cause and consequences of myopia.”\nIndustry: The developed technologies have been licensed to industrial partners for commercial use. Since the launch of the DIMS spectacle lens in the summer of 2018, Hoya has organized 3,787 seminars in Hong Kong and the Mainland, and attracted 75,569 practitioners to the workshops, seminars and talks [S3]. The company received positive feedback on the effectiveness of the lens for myopia control, and it foresees significant demand for the lens in Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia and Korea.\nVision Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (VST), one of the licensed partners since 2017, reported that over 1,400 pairs of DISC lenses were prescribed in Hong Kong from June 2018 to June 2019. VST launched the DISC lens in China in April 2019, and ~3,000 pairs of lenses were prescribed by the end of June 2019 [S4].\nPublic Sectors: The DIMS lens is available to all eye care practitioners for prescription to the general public in both Hong Kong and the Mainland. At our optometry clinic at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, ~1,000 pairs of DIMS lenses were prescribed from June 2018 to January 2019, representing ~25% of all the lenses prescribed during that period. To assist in the use and extend the impact of our research, we have offered 25 training workshops/seminars since September 2017, in which there have been a total of 13,400 participants.\nGovernment: The innovation of spectacle intervention to retard myopia has been recognized by the Hong Kong government. In her public speech to congratulate the winners of the 46th International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong cited the DIMS lens as a good example of government funding [S5]. The citation of this lens, to attract IT talent, also appeared in the “Innovation” booklet distributed by the Hong Kong Government Innovation and Technology Bureau [S6].\nGlobal: SO has continued to play an active role in developing general guidelines for clinical use. Two faculty members from SO served on the international experts’ panels for two white papers published in February 2019, in a renowned ophthalmology and vision research journal [S7, S8].",

  "text": "Media \nMedia Releases \n15 Dec 2022\nEvents School of Optometry \nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has joined hands with Aier Eye Hospital Group (Aier) to provide six to eight weeks of clinical training in Aier’s eye hospitals and clinics in mainland China and overseas cities for a maximum of 30 selected students with outstanding academic performance from PolyU’s School of Optometry in five years. The two parties will also explore opportunities to conduct collaborative research on major eye health challenges.\nThe partnership brings together the complementary strengths of the School’s world-leading research capability (with its research impact ranking first in Asia according to Clinical and Experimental Optometry), and Aier’s vast network of over 900 hospitals and clinics in Asia, the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia, making it a leading global ophthalmology hospital group.\nThe signing ceremony was held today on PolyU’s campus. Witnessed by Prof. Kwok-yin WONG, Vice President (Education) of PolyU, Prof. David SHUM, Dean of Faculty of Health and Social Sciences of PolyU, and Ms Elaine ZHANG, Global Strategy and Business Development Director of Aier Eye Hospital Group signed the memorandum of understanding. Prof. Chea-su KEE, Professor and Interim Head of School of Optometry of PolyU and Ms Zhang also signed the agreement on the clinical placement arrangement.\nProf. Wong said, “Aier Eye Hospital Group is a well-established medical institution in terms of its massive teams of professional ophthalmologists and optometrists, as well as having over 900 well-equipped eye hospitals and clinics across Hong Kong, mainland China, the USA, Europe and Southeast Asia. PolyU is delighted to further strengthen its strategic collaboration with Aier in advancing the research and clinical talent development of optometry, particularly in terms of providing more comprehensive training for optometry students to accelerate the field’s development in the country and the world.”\nMs Zhang remarked, “With Aier’s global eye hospital and clinic network, we are gratified to provide PolyU students with clinical training, including diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. They will gain the opportunity to have first-hand experience of global eye care and medical development, which will help them build a macro and deep professional foundation for their future career.”\nThe School has been proactively collaborating with local ophthalmologists and counterparts around the world to provide students with hands-on experience, preparing them for their future careers in optometry. With the clinical training offered by Aier, the students will further benefit. Prof. Kee added, “The support from Aier will enhance the School’s optometric education and help take the local optometric profession to the next level.” \nClinical training cooperation between PolyU and Aier has been in place since 2017. Aier has also set up scholarships for optometry students from PolyU and offered them placement opportunities in its Hong Kong branches. \n*****END*****",

Two of my classmates and I were given an opportunity to visit The School of Optometry and Vision Science of QUT, which provides us clinical training on primary eye care consultation and specialist services such as color vision assessments, contact lens clinics, therapeutics clinic, vision rehabilitation, etc. We had on-ground experiences on prescribing therapeutic eye drops to manage various ocular diseases while prescribing rights for Hong Kong optometrists has not been legalized yet. Building rapports with patients of different ethnic backgrounds was a big challenge and yet a precious chance to enhance my communication skills and confidence. Apart from Optometry clinic, the QUT Health clinic also includes other healthcare professions like Psychology and Counseling, Podiatry, Nutrition, etc. It was a great opportunity for us to appreciate the beauty of multi-disciplinary effort on promoting one’s quality of life.\nIt was an enjoyable stay in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland. The local students and supervisors were very welcoming and we had great fun there. Throughout the trip, I realized the power of determination and perseverance. We should not give up easily in spite of obstacles or discouragements. Every effort counts and it moves us one step closer to our goals. This exchange programme really offered me an inspiring and rewarding life experience.",

My fellow classmates and I were attached to the Department of Optometry and Vision Science, the University of Melbourne, which offered us clinical training, ophthalmic lectures and clinical grand rounds. As the most livable city in the world, Melbourne also brought us a very pleasant life experience there.\nThe University of Melbourne is the only school that offers the Doctor of Optometry (OD) degree in Australia. Therefore, we got to work with their post-graduate students and learnt a lot from them. We had hands-on experience of therapeutic management for different ocular problems, which is not yet legally permissible for optometrists to carry out in Hong Kong. The contrast between patients we came across in Australia and in Hong Kong was another highlight. The patients in Melbourne were diverse culturally and ethnically, which turned out to be a great opportunity to boost my communication skills. Besides attending clinics, we also had clinical grand rounds and several ophthalmic seminars covering some up-to-date topics.\nLast but not least, the trip has boosted my self-confidence; we should never underestimate the power of confidence and the difference that we could make. This one-month exchange programme was short but it indeed inspired me in the long term.",

  "text": "Ground-Breaking Glaucoma Research, Diagnostics & Treatments\nGlaucoma is frequently associated with excessive eye pressure. Prof. TO Chi-ho, who is the Henry G. Leong Professor in Elderly Vision Health, and his research team discovered the cellular transport system that produces eye pressure. This has exposed new cellular targets for the development of potent treatments for glaucoma. \nA research team led by Associate Professors Dr DO Chi-wai and Dr Henry CHAN has also found that common traditional Chinese medicines such as baicalein and Lycium barbarum may have good therapeutic potential as anti-glaucoma agents because of their ocular hypotensive as well as neuroprotective effects.\nFor glaucoma diagnosis, multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) is a highly sensitive method. Another team led by Dr Chan has invented a major clinical protocol for mfERG measurement that significantly improves the sensitivity and specificity to over 90% for glaucoma diagnosis. This new protocol enables the detection of subtle damage at least three to four years earlier than all existing clinical tests can. ",

It was definitely an unforgettable experience. \nAustralian optometrists are able to prescribe therapeutic drugs whenever needed. In contrast, such therapeutic management by optometrists is currently prohibited in Hong Kong. I had some hands-on experience in prescribing antibiotics and steroids during the clinical placement. I could fully practise what I learnt in Hong Kong. I also had the opportunity to attend some clinical rounds and lectures with the local students studying the 4-year Doctor of Optometry programme. These sessions were both fun and immensely useful. I also sat in several specialty clinics such as colour vision clinic, cornea clinic, and glaucoma clinic\nIt is hard to share every pleasurable experience, but in short, I would recommend Year 4 students to exchange to UM. I would also like to sincerely thank our School and the Department of Optometry & Vision Sciences of UM for organizing such a wonderful trip.",

  "text": "School of Optometry (SO) and Research Centre for SHARP Vision (RCSV) \nSpeaker\nProf. Deborah Giaschi\nAbstract\nDevelopmental dyslexia is a common learning disability characterized by difficulty in the acquisition of reading skills. Although neurobiological in nature, the cause is largely unknown. Deficits in motion perception and visual attention are well documented, but the role of these deficits in the diagnosis and treatment of dyslexia remains controversial. Vulnerability in the dorsal visual stream during development has been proposed to underlie dyslexia and other developmental disorders, but reading deficits may be better linked to the ventral stream. I will review current diagnostic criteria, theories about single core deficits versus multifactorial causes, and recommendations on the role of eye care professionals in the management of dyslexia. I will then present functional MRI work from my lab on the neural correlates of reading and motion perception deficits, functional connectivity between language and visual areas, and cortical changes in response to reading intervention.\nProf. Deborah Giaschi\nProfessor, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Canada\nDeborah Giaschi is a Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and an associate member of the Department of Psychology and the Department of Pediatrics. Her research lab is at BC Children’s Hospital where she studies the typical and atypical development of vision in children. She uses behavioural and MRI techniques to understand the neural basis of dyslexia and amblyopia to advance new methods of treatment. She obtained her PhD in Experimental Psychology at York University in Toronto in 1990 under the supervision of Professor Stuart Anstis.",
