  "text": "BRE Luncheon Research Seminars \nThis seminar is held online via Zoom usually on Thursdays from 12:30 pm to 2:00 pm, unless other time arrangement is informed in advance. \n\nMission \nThe purpose of the seminar is to help create an air of professional seriousness through scholarly interaction in BRE. The seminar is held for not only enriching academic staff’s research experience by interacting with peers and exchanging ideas, but also providing great opportunities for research staff and students in particular to attain and handle opinions from different angles for more rigorous research and discussions. It is envisioned that all participants can learn by getting information from research and broaden research horizons in different fields. \n\nThe Format \nThe seminar runs by providing light lunch to participants in the first 10-15 minutes, followed by the speaker’s presentation for around 1 hour and a 15-minutes Q&A session. The contents of presentation can be general research ideas, research methodologies, research outcomes, conference or journal papers recently published or under preparation, to name a few. There is no fixed presentation format. The presentation format is flexible to allow speakers to use their own preferred format. A certificate will be issued to the speaker for acknowledgement. All in all, a causal seminar with vigorous and helpful discussions is expected. \n\nContact \nPlease contact Dr. Amos DARKO at amosdarko@polyu.edu.hk or (852) 2766 7806 if you wish to give a presentation, suggest other speakers or have any queries regarding the seminar.

  "text": "News \n1 / 1\n<< Prof Heng Li, Chair Professor of Construction Informatics, Awarded in Smart Living Partnership Awards 2022 >>\nProf. Heng Li’s steadfast pursuit of digital and smart solutions to construction problems was highly praised with the ETNet Award in Smart Living Partnership Awards 2022. This honour further expands Prof. Li’s accolade list. Congratulations to Prof. Li! \nFunded by Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre (LSCM), Prof. Li’s winning project developed a computer vision-enabled digital twin for construction resource and progress management. The construction industry has played a key role in Hong Kong and been an instrumental driver of economic growth and enabler of social development for many generations. Whilst the construction industry has a long and proud history, it has produced a large amount of construction wastes that are difficult to be monitored. Digital Twin is a concept of having a real-time digital representation of a physical object, which allows up-to-date information to be fed back to the field so as to provides automatic resource allocation monitoring and waste tracking in construction management. This winning project transforms the construction management practice to be a population-based, intensive, and proactive process; it improves resource productivity, reduces resource waste and progress lagging, as well as improves project performance.\nSmart Living Partnership Awards 2022 aims to recognise and support outstanding companies or organisations which are committed to promoting Hong Kong as a Smart City. Improving society’s competitiveness and increasing public awareness of digitalisation are at the heart of it.\nThe Award Presentation Ceremony will be held on 27 February 2023. We wish Prof Li every success in his future endeavors!\nMore about Prof. Heng Li : https://polyu.hk/ZHFSI\nMore about #BRE : https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bre/",

As the current trend of digital shift in the built environment sector, particularly in the construction sector, has continued to grow, construction professionals require competent construction related IT skills to perform their professional services effectively and efficiently. To address the significant volume of predicted construction activities adopting innovation and advanced technologies, the Hong Kong SAR Government is taking the initiative to be a leading agent for the change. This is presented in “Construction 2.0 - Time to Change” – an expression of the construction industry’s changes required across three key pillars: Innovation, Professionalism and Revitalisation.\nOther additional initiatives are also put forward to ensure the construction industry is collectively allocating its resources to bring a resounding positive impact. These initiatives include science and technologies in BIM, IoT, Robotics, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality, Electronic Sensing Technology, Advanced Computing Technology, and Machine Learning. Accordingly, Intelligent Construction Technologies (ICT) are a combination of the above-mentioned modern science and innovative construction technologies. ICT has been designed to save costs, reduce delivery time and improve the quality and safety of construction projects throughout the entire life cycle from planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation and demolition.\nThe programme aims to train up construction related students and professionals with strong digital construction related skills supported by ICT tools to perform their professional services in construction projects more intelligently. The core objectives of the programme are:\nTo equip students with state-of-the-art ICT and digital construction technical skills required for construction projects, such as BIM, Robotics, 3D Printing, Visualisation and Interactive Technologies, and Machine Learning.\nTo integrate the necessary knowledge and a range of analytical tools, digital skills, and transferable skills for the needs of construction professionals.\nTo develop students with skills of construction engineering management through pioneering digital approaches in both theoretical and applied aspects.\nTo cultivate critical thinking and research spirit in decision-making and problem-solving in the context of managing construction projects using digital approaches.",

  "text": "The BRE Mentorship Scheme was launched in 1999, well ahead of any other similar schemes in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. It is available to all full time degree students reading the Building Engineering and Management, Property Management, and Surveying programmes. Participating students are assigned a personal mentor when they commence their studies as freshmen. These mentors are senior professionals in their respective fields and specializations and thus will be providing the most relevant mentoring to the students’ career development. \nOnce the students have developed amicable relationship with their mentors, they can expect parental guidance and nurturing throughout their entire curriculum. They can also expect enlightenment and steering into their career path. Many graduates have testified that this is truly a 『一日為師、終生為父』relationship and they are keeping very close liaison with their mentors even after their graduation and professional qualification. \nBy 2020, we have over 160 active mentors who are professional Building Surveyors, General Practice Surveyors, Maintenance Surveyors, Quantity Surveyors, Building Contractors, Construction Engineers, Facility Managers, Project Managers, Property Managers, etc. Mentors are very enthusiastic and they dedicate unselfishly in bringing up their mentees. Mentors will normally be assigned new freshmen every year while their former mentees are progressing to the second and third years. So when a mentor calls up all his mentees for a gathering, it is also a socialization of the students, including graduates, of different years in the same programme. This is certainly an added value to the students in their career networking. \nContact Person: Dr Patrick SW FONG ( Mentorship and Alumni Relations Coordinator) / Ms Janice LAU",

  "text": "Outstanding Young BRE Graduates\nLAU Nga Yi Maria\n2019 Graduate with MPhil (Cambridge)\n2018 Graduate with BSc (Hons) in Surveying\nChoosing the BSc (Hons) in Surveying is the best decision I have made in my life so far. \nSurveying is a discipline that conflates construction technology, economics, finance and land administration as well as law; these skills are subsequently applied to the real estate market. The interdisciplinary training provided by BRE has got me where I am today. The courses offered by the department are genuinely practical yet academic enough to lead easily into further studies. I went on to study for an MPhil degree with the University of Cambridge immediately after my undergraduate degree. Moreover, I was also blessed by the vast variety of industry and international connections that PolyU and BRE have. Using these, I had the chance to explore the Hong Kong, Guangzhou and London real estate markets through a series of internships. The unfailing guidance and generous support I have received from the department are things I was not likely to find elsewhere. \nBRE has empowered its graduates to become surveyors of integrity and professionalism. We are equipped to take on not only a specialist role in real estate markets but also a generalist role in many other disciplines, which is what I have deeded to do. I am excited that I take a role with HSBC Private Banking as a Management Associate. I explore the realm of wealth and asset management and apply the soft skills and knowledge acquired from my surveying degree. Although I entered a completely new environment, I still feel secure and confident that my four years at PolyU have been more than well spent and have adequately prepared me for any challenges ahead. \nI am heartily thankful to have read for the Surveying degree with PolyU. A successful programme enables its graduates to thrive, not only in the specific discipline they study, but also in society at large. I could never have imagined how far the BSc (Hons) Surveying degree would take me in my career. BRE was a platform that helped me unleash my potential. I truly look forward to seeing one day what I can give back to my Alma Mater.",

  "text": "In the old days, the economies of Hong Kong depended very much on manufacturing. The manufacturing sector contributed only 1.1% of the HK GDP in 2017 while it was 21.7% in 1987. The total private flatted factories at the end of 2017 was 16,525,600 sq m. while the figure at the end of 1987 was 14,461,300 sq m. About 39% of the current stocks are built in pre 1980. From the above figures, it is clearly that transformation of aged industrial space is inevitable. Substantial amount of the existing stocks should have been changed to non-industrial uses. It is just a matter whether we leave this to the market entirely or guided by the government policies in a tidy manner. \nMajor comprehensive redevelopments were motivated by market forces. Examples are Taikoo Shing, Whampao Garden, Amoy Garden, Tai Hing Garden etc. All these are large pieces of land owned by single owners. Piecemeal redevelopments of aged industrial buildings owned by single owners were not uncommon too. Quite a number of cases of conversion of aged buildings to commercial use happened after the nil premium policy adopted by the government about 10 years ago. But we still have no policy to tackle the situation of multi-owned factory space. Should we encourage redevelopment or refurbishment? How can we get the owners to come together? These are fundamental questions which solutions are needed.",

  "text": "According to the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are tools that help public sectors leverage the expertise and efficiency of the private sector, raise capital, and spur development. They also help allocate risk across the public and private sectors to where it can best be managed and ensure that resources are wisely distributed in addressing the most urgent development needs. PPPs may include procurement approaches under all forms of DBFOM (Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain) such as DBO, DBFO, BOT, BOO, BOT or BOOT. \nMore and more governments and public organizations in the world, including Hong Kong, have used PPP approach to deliver large-scale, long-term public asset and services for the community. The Cross-Harbour Tunnel, for example, was procured via a 30-year private-sector franchised BOT model. In view of the growing international interest in PPP including projects under the Belt & Road Initiative of China, the Institution of Public Private Partnerships (IPPP) in Hong Kong has been established to provide a platform to share PPP knowledge with an aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of delivering PPP projects. The IPPP promotes the World Bank Group PPP model through the World Bank CP3P Certification Program and supports lectures on PPP. \nProf. Johri will share his insight into the evolving PPP approaches over the past decades and highlight the internationally recognized good practices in the preparation, procurement, and management of PPPs.",

One-third of Canada’s 75,000 highway bridges have structural or functional deficiencies and short remaining service lives. Hong Kong has 1,340 bridges, of which 7% and 40% are above 50 and 30 years old, respectively, now showing several signs of ageing. Québec bridges have reached 72% of their service lives.

  "text": "Hong Kong’s strategic land reserve no doubt rested in the vast brownfield sites in the New Territories and potential reclamations from the sea. The Government proposed four New Development Areas as well as the North New Territories New Town which cover altogether more than 600 ha of brownfield sites. The Tung Chung New Town Expansion and the proposed East Lantau Metropolis consist of reclamations respectively in the size of 120 ha and 400 to 700 ha. The CITY PROBLEM is perhaps not “where”, but “how” such sheer size of land can come for development. \nThe problem of aging population has already caught the attention of our city, but less is the problem of aging housing stock. Compared with today, percentage of 85+ elderlies in our population will increase from 2.2% by about 5 times to 10.1% in 2064, whilst private housing units aged 70 years or above will increase by 300 times to 326,000 units in 2046. The combined impact of this “double-aging” trend on our city is not only unprecedented in our experience but perhaps unique in the world. This is one of the most difficult challenges that we must overcome in the coming decades to avoid Hong Kong becoming a PROBLEM CITY. \nInnovative institutional arrangement and technical solutions must be worked out to turn challenges into opportunities for making Hong Kong a better place for our people. Endowed with strong research capacity, universities are obliged to contribute. The city is our laboratory. These challenges will provide academia in various disciplines under the umbrella of urban sciences with unique opportunities for world-class research.",

  "text": "BRE PhD candidate Miss CHENG Chun and her supervisor Prof. Meng Ni awarded the HKIE Outstanding Paper Award for Young Engineers/Researchers 2022\nAbout the research:\nIn 2021, the United States already consumed approximately 1.026 569 × 1011 GJ of energy, where about two-thirds is discharged into the environment without effective reuse. As a primary form of waste energy, low-grade waste heat (<150oC) not only causes energy loss but also thermal pollution. Converting heat to electricity via a thermodynamic cycle is effective for utilizing high-temperature heat but the efficiency is extremely low for low-grade heat, for example, 9%-16% within a working temperature range of 80-150K for the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems. For comparison, electrochemical thermocells offer an alternative way of converting low-grade waste heat into electricity at a potentially higher efficiency than conventional thermodynamic cycles. In our previous research, we successfully achieved a relative efficiency of 50.817% (relative to Carnot efficiency) with a recuperation efficiency of 70% at a temperature difference of 30K. Although some pioneering experimental investigations have been reported on thermocells, the current literature is lacking comprehensive modeling and optimization of the cells, which is critical not only for the in-depth understanding of the working mechanisms of the thermocells, but also for engineering design and optimization. In this work, we developed a numerical model to simulate the physical and chemical processes in the thermocell. We evaluated the effects of the operating and structural parameters on the performance of thermocells and identified several potential means to improve cell performance. Based on our optimization, the cell power density can be improved by up to 30%. \nAbout the award:\nThis work has been awarded the HKIE Outstanding Paper Award for Young Engineers/Researchers 2022.\nThis award is organized by The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE) to encourage young engineers and researchers worldwide aged 35 or below to publish their works and advance in their professional fields and to promote engineering advancement.\nAbout the PHD candidate:\nMiss CHENG Chun is a PHD student at BRE, under supervision of Prof. Meng Ni, Professor of BRE and Associate Dean (Research) of FCE. Her research focuses on electrochemical systems for low grade heat utilization. Apart from this award-winning publication, Miss CHENG has published 3 papers in excellent journals, including two papers in ACS Energy Letters and 1 paper in Chemical Engineering Journal. \nMore information about Prof. Meng Ni can be found at:\nhttps://www.polyu.edu.hk/bre/people/academic-staff/prof-meng-ni/",

  "text": "Students may pursue their studies either on a full-time or part-time mode. Students enrolling in the full-time mode are recommended to complete 7 subjects and a dissertation. For the part-time mode, the first year emphasizes project management processes and techniques, providing students with contemporary and in-depth knowledge of project management. This is supplemented by insights into the major factors that affect real estate development. In the second year, elements such as value management, finance and international construction provide specialized knowledge of construction project management at the macro level. \nThe critical analysis, evaluation and application of the knowledge to be gained from the programme is integrated with student experience into a research-based Dissertation after 7 subjects have been completed. However, students can complete 3 additional subjects instead of the MSc Dissertation. For the full-time mode, classes may be conducted during weekdays, weekends and in the evenings. For the part-time mode, classes are mostly conducted during weekends. To enhance self-study, study materials for the Core Subjects are provided by the Department of Building and Real Estate.",

  "text": "Awards and Achievements (Research) \nIn collaboration with Nanjing Tech University (China) and Colorado School of Mines (USA), Prof. Meng Ni, a Professor and Associate Head (Research) of BRE, co-authored a research article entitled “Thermal-expansion offset for high-performance fuel cell cathodes” in Nature. \nThe first author, Dr Yuan Zhang, worked in Prof. Meng Ni’s lab for 1 year where she conducted part of the experimental research reported in this Nature paper. The second author, Dr Bin Chen (now an Assistant Professor at Shenzhen University, China), received his PhD in 2018 from BRE under supervision of Prof. Meng Ni. The corresponding authors are Prof. Zongping Shao and Prof. Wei Zhou, who are supervisors of Dr. Yuan Zhang and are both from Nanjing Tech University. \nHigh temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have the potential to replace conventional thermal power plants for energy conversion. One challenge for SOFC commercialization is thermo-mechanical instability due to mismatch in thermal expansion behaviour between different fuel cell components, which can cause cell performance degradation or even failure. In this research article, a novel electrode development strategy is proposed by compositing a cobalt-based perovskite with high electrochemical activity and large thermal expansion coefficient with a negative thermal expansion material. A new interface is formed between the two materials. A-site deficiencies in the perovskite are also observed. As a result, the composite electrode shows both high electrochemical activity and excellent thermos-mechanical stability. This research provides a new strategy for the development of high performance and durable solid oxide fuel cells for efficient and clean power generation. ",

Dr Kingsford Owusu, a Research Assistant Professor and a PhD graduate of BRE, is very pleased to receive the HKIS Dissertation/Thesis Awards for Postgraduate Students in July 2020. The Awards are based on merits in research as well as the applicability of the research output to the Surveying profession. \nDr Owusu’s study examined the issue of corruption in infrastructure project procurement in developed and developing economies. It examined the various forms of corrupt practices and their associated causal factors, procurement irregularities, anti-corruption measures (ACMs), and the barriers that hamper the efficacy of the extant ACMs. This research deployed a diverse range of methodological tools and techniques to answer the questions raised and address the study's aim and objectives. They include but are not limited to descriptive statistics, fuzzy synthetic evaluation, social network analysis, and system dynamics. The models and framework developed in this study constitute an overarching ACM dynamic framework to predict and extirpate corruption in public infrastructure procurement.\nDr Owusu said, “I am more than grateful to receive this award on behalf of the Department of BRE. This achievement would not have been possible without the stupendous supervision of my supervisor, Prof. Albert Chan. I would like to dedicate this award to him and everyone in the BRE Department. I hope to continue with the hard work to win more awards for the Department.”",

  "text": "Prof. Lam is leading a team working on a General Research Fund study on Cost-Benefit Analysis for smart city projects, the first of which concerns Car Parking Apps in Hong Kong. He will be exploring this subject with participants in the Lecture. \nA smart city project embraces both direct and indirect benefits and costs. Externalities come into the picture but they are often difficult to quantify. Despite this barrier, policy makers need to carry out Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to decide on the huge investments to make a city smart. A research is being conducted, focusing on the identification of costs (on a life cycle basis) and benefits associated with smart city project developments. Through the use of established methods, the aim is to build up a framework for carrying out CBA of smart city projects. The findings will be useful for policy makers of cities.",

To cope with the increasing proportion of renewable energy in China, and maintain a stable and safe power supply, the electricity system should be able to support high wattage with long-term energy storage. The team developed the “zinc-air battery”, which is a promising technology as a long-duration energy storage device with the advantages of low cost, high safety, and large discharge capacity. The battery working principle is that the zinc anode reacts with the ambient air to generate electricity, and this process is highly reversible.\nWinning research team: \nMentor:\nProf. Meng NI, Associate Dean, Faculty of Construction and Environment, PolyU\nMembers:\nSiyuan ZHAO, Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering Year 3\nWen ZHENG, BSc (Hons) in Property Management Year 2\nSuet Fei LAU, BSc (Hons) in Property Management Year 3\nJielin HUANG, BSc (Hons) in Surveying Year 3\nJianwei HUANG, BSc (Hons) in Surveying Year 2\nJiarui HE, BSc (Hons) in Building Engineering and Management Year 2",
