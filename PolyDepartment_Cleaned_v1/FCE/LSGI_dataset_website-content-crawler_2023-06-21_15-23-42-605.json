  "text": "Department Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics \nEntrance Year Sept 2023 \nProgramme Code \nAims and Characteristics\nEstablished in 1983, the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI) is the only academic unit amongst the local tertiary institutions offering a range of opportunities for education, training and research in the fields of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (or Geomatics). The Department has close links with both international and local academic institutions and the professions. By maintaining links with the local professional community through our community service and consultancy activities, our courses and research are oriented towards the needs of Hong Kong. \nThe Department has identified Urban Informatics and Smart City as its strategic area, with three corresponding focused research directions: a) spatial big data modelling and analytics; b) smart positioning and smart mobility; and c) urban sensing and measurement. As a regional centre of excellence in geomatics research, LSGI is comparable with international reputed academic units in the discipline, as evidenced by both the quantity and quality of the research produced and research grants received.\nThe PhD and MPhil programmes aim to provide rigorous training to students who aspire to become researchers and/or scholars capable of producing independent and original research, and of producing research findings that are relevant and significant to their chosen fields of specialisation.\nThe MPhil study requires candidates to undertake critical study of a chosen area while the PhD study demands candidates to accomplish a study which makes a significant contribution to knowledge deserving of publication.",

  "text": "Background\nAcademic advising at PolyU aims to help students to make informed and intelligent academic decisions/choices about their study at PolyU that suit their intellectual, professional and personal goals. It is instrumental in promoting student success and plays a vital role in enhancing students' overall learning experience at PolyU.\nAcademic advising at PolyU has two tiers:\n1) Department-based academic advising (primarily for Broad Discipline and Major Programme matters)\n2) Academic advising at the institutional level operated by the Office of General University Requirements (OGUR - primarily for matters related to the GUR)\nAcademic Advising System\nLSGI students of 4-year curriculum programmes will be assigned to one academic advisor throughout their whole period of study in LSGI. The Board Discipline students will be assigned an Academic Advisor once they have confirmed their major of study in LSGI.\nWithin the first week from the start of the first semester, a meeting for all students will be held to introduce AAs and to brief students of academic advising. Each student is expected to have an individual face-to-face meeting with his/her academic advisor at the beginning of each academic year to discuss his/her study plan. Additional individual or small-group meetings with his/her academic advisor can be made if necessary. Students may also consult their academic advisors via emails and/or other means whenever necessary.\nEach student advisee will fill out a log report and return the report to the AA after each face-to-face or small group meeting. The AA is required to endorse the log report and send it to the Undergraduate Secretary for the record (and follow-up actions if necessary).\nThe undergraduate Secretary of LSGI will also provide you with the updated information regarding policies, regulations and procedures on your academic study.\nRoles and Responsibilities of Academic Advises\nBuilding rapport with students\nBeing accessible, available and responsive\nHelping students clarify their intellectual, professional and personal goals\nAlerting students to academic regulations and requirements, particularly those pertinent to LSGI\nGuiding students to identify the specialism and/or a double degree to study on the basis of their interests and develop appropriate study plans\nEarly identifying students with special learning needs or early signs of learning problems and making necessary referrals\nAcademic Advisors (AA)\nStudents will be notified of their AAs' details at the beginning of their first academic year.

  "text": "Planetary Remote Sensing and Mapping Supporting Space Exploration Missions New Technology for Remote Monitoring of the Environment and Hazards Fundamental Theories and Models for Spatial Big Data Analytics Reliable Navigation and Smart Transport Techniques for Highly Dense Urban Areas \nHigh-precision and high-resolution topographic information for surface hazard analysis and landing site evaluation are vital for the success of any landing mission to planetary bodies. They are also essential for planetary science research. A LSGI research group led by Prof. Bo Wu has systematically researched planetary remote sensing over the past decade. They have advanced research and development in planetary mapping and remote sensing data analysis. A new integrated 3D mapping model has been developed for high-precision and high-resolution topographic mapping of the Moon and Mars, surpassing all existing technology, such as photogrammetry or laser altimetry. Novel deep learning approaches have also been developed for more automated and robust analysis of planetary remote sensing data. These developments led to a 'Gold Medal' and an 'R. Alekseev Award' for the PolyU team at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva in April 2016. The research article about multiple-source data integration for precision lunar topographic mapping was cited by Nature Index as 'a landmark paper on lunar topographic models' in an analysis of the research produced by universities in Hong Kong. The developments and results have been extensively used for landing site mapping and characterisation for China’s lunar and Mars landing missions.\n(Photo caption: Prof. Bo Wu at the launch site of Chang’E-4 in Xichang Satellite Launch Center) \n\nEnvironmental change and geohazards often have drastic impacts on our society. A better understanding of the problems and developing effective technologies to detect the precursors of emergent situations can help mitigate the problems and reduce their effects. A group of LSGI researchers, including Prof. Xiaoli Ding, Prof. George Liu, Dr Charles Wong, and Dr Wallace Lai, has developed advanced satellite and ground-based remote sensing technologies to study the environment, geohazards and problems in urban infrastructure (including underground utilities and infrastructure). Their extensive research findings have been published in some top international journals, leading the technological advancement in this research area. The technologies have been widely used in Hong Kong and internationally, contributing to a healthier and safer living environment. For example, technologies for mapping the effect of urban air quality and heat islands and health conditions of underground utilities have been transferred to various Departments of the Hong Kong SAR government, such as the Planning Department, Lands Department, Hong Kong Observatory and the Water Services Department. The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) deformation monitoring technology has been used widely in Taiwan, Korea, Mainland China and Hong Kong for landslides and structural safety monitoring. The multi-antenna GNSS technology developed by this team has become an industry standard for deformation monitoring. Several awards have been received, including the first prize of the Natural Science Award from the Ministry of Education in China in 2014. \nBig data is meaningless without data analysis. A LSGI research group has made systematic studies on the theories and methods for modelling uncertainty and quality control of spatial data, modelling the uncertainty propagation in spatial analysis and surface reconstruction and measuring and computing the reliability in spatial analyses and spatial data mining, algorithms and models for spatial modelling, including the multi-scale representation of spatial data and spatial analysis results. The theoretical research on uncertainty in data quality and spatial analysis has been widely applied in spatial data quality assessment and control in Hong Kong and the region, the data quality assessment standards of Macao Geographic Information System (GIS) data for the Macao government, and the quality assessment for the first National Geographic State Survey of China. An extended WKDE model was developed and forecasted COVID-19 onset risk for the whole pandemic period in China. The decrease of the onset risk attributed to the Wuhan lockdown was more than 8% to 21.3% in cities in China. The work in digital terrain modelling has been the basis for the establishment of the national accuracy specifications for digital elevation models and used for quality control in the establishment of national digital elevation models. Highly recognised internationally, the work has honoured Prof. Wen-zhong Shi and Prof. Zhilin Li with the State Natural Science Award (the second class prize) from the Central Government of China in 2007 and 2004, respectively. They also won prestigious awards from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. \n(Photo caption: COVID-19 illness onset risk prediction for 347 cities in China on 30th of Jan 2020.)\nLocation-based services and vehicle navigation have become emerging spatial information technologies. The GNSS-based (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) positioning and navigation technology is the cornerstone for numerous applications in modern society. A research group in LSGI has identified a number of key problems related to GNSS positioning and navigation in dense urban areas, such as Hong Kong. Prof. Wu Chen’s team has been contributing to the enhancement of the accuracy of city navigation by developing a seamless urban navigation system overcoming the inaccurate outdoor positioning due to multi-path effects in urban centres packed with skyscrapers, low latitude ionosphere anomaly, a highly humid GNSS observation environment and canyon effect. The lateral accuracy has been largely improved. These improvements were resulted after modelling, analysing and integrating the GNSS signals from China’s BeiDou, GPS of the US, Europe’s Galileo, and Russia’s GLONASS. A powerful cloud server ensures that the positioning is updated in real-time, supporting various smart city functions. \nGNSS has also been integrated with GIS (Geographic Information System) for vehicle navigation and public transport systems. Such work addresses some of the key problems in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) with great industrial and societal effects. In addition to the development of a land vehicle navigation system with 95% reliability, the research team also developed a public transport inquiry system (HKeTransport) that has been available for public use since 2010. The product for enhancing the public transport system has won a Merit Award in Mobile Infotainment of HK Wireless Technology Excellence Award (2005), a Best Public Service Application Silver Award in ICT Award (2009) and a Meritorious Award of the Civil Service Outstanding Award (2011). The system has been incorporated in HKeMobility, a one-stop platform by the Transport Department in 2018. \nPedestrian positioning test in Wanchai: The seamless urban navigation system (blue lines) yields far more accurate results than a smartphone (red lines).",

  "text": "About LSGIAA\nThe Land Surveying & Geo-Informatics Alumni Association (LSGIAA) was officially established in 1996 as a non-profit incorporation. Mr. Au Chi Ho, the 1st President of LSGIAA, together with a group of enthusiastic alumni formed the 1st executive committee to organize activities and strive for the benefits for LSGI alumni. \nStarting with 1996, alumni members keep on growing yearly. Hence, we are looking forward to recruiting more members from graduates (both undergraduates and postgraduates) of Department of LSGI in the forthcoming years. In light of this competitive advantage of crossing over in one alumni association, members can extend through us personal career network and horizon which is definitely beneficial to their career and interpersonal relations. Furthermore, members can also attend CPD events and activities with special offers.\nIn 1998, LSGIAA joined as a member association of the Federation of Hong Kong Polytechnic University Alumni Association. It was signifying that our Association is now an integral part of the enlarged PolyU Alumni family.\nIn 2009, with the endorsement of Vice President of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, our association was registered as “The Land Surveying & Geo-Informatics Alumni Association of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University“ and in Chinese “香港理工大學土地測量及地理資料學系”. All these are stated in our latest constitution.",

  "text": "Welcome to the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics. Over the past 10 years, it has experienced extensive rapid development to the point by which it is now ranked as the leading Geomatics department in the academic world, in accordance with the SCI citation per staff.\nThe geomatics discipline of the Department covers not only traditional land surveying but also, and even more importantly, the latest spatial information sciences and technologies. The latter includes geographic information science and systems, global navigation satellite systems and satellite remote sensing. These highly sophisticated technologies have been widely used not only for advanced scientific programmes, such as Beidou and lunar exploration missions, but also for daily living, such as individual public transport mode selection and in-car navigation. Our colleagues have been involved in upstream scientific research and downstream applied technological development.\nThe key factors influencing the department's quality teaching and high research achievements are the innovative thinking and enthusiasm of our staff. Currently, we have approximately 70 staff members in the Department, with 22 academic staff, and some of whom are leading scholars and respected internationally in their fields. Additionally, we have 10 experienced supporting staff and 34 dedicated research personnel. The PhD or post-doc qualifications, together with further academic staff experience, were acquired in many countries including Canada, Germany, China Hong Kong, the UK and the USA.\nUrban geo-informatics for the further exploration of smart city concepts has been identified as the strategic development direction of the Department in last few years. This framework focuses on a wide range of research, including urban geo--informatics, smart city, spatial big data analytics, mobile mapping, urban disaster mitigation, positioning and navigation, utility surveys and management, planetary mapping, urban 3D modelling and remote sensing for environmental studies. The Department’s annual research funding increased by five times during the past 6 years, including knowledge transfer projects and ITF projects. Apart from basic research, active engagement in applied research and knowledge transfer also exists, which further contributes by holding important roles in various professional organisations and government advisory committees.\nIn addition to highly respected research achievements, the Department is dedicated to offering a full range of geomatics programmes. These programmes include Higher Diplomas, Bachelor of Science, Master of Science and PhD. The Department has a total of over 500 registered local and international students. The above programmes are accredited by local and regional professional institutions, including HKIS, RICS, HKIE and HKIES.

  "text": "Organiser\nDepartment of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI)\nRemarks\nAll are welcome. It is free.\nSummary\nThe aviation sector has always been technology driven. Yet the aviation sector has not been able to harness the power of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) as much as some other sectors. Targeting this opportunity, I develop analytical methods to improve the operations of air transportation systems with the use of large-scale data generated from real-world operations. These data include sensor values on aircraft components, airline operations status, as well as external information i.e., traffic congestion. It is a computational challenge to extract and model the dependences among diversified data sources effectively and efficiently. To tackle this challenge, I propose a new framework to integrate domain knowledge, physics/mechanism models and various AI technologies. In this talk, I will demonstrate how this framework can used for the design and operations of air transport systems via several examples, e.g. anomaly detection in flight data recorder data, modeling national air traffic network activities, etc.\nPoster\nKeynote Speaker\nDr Lishuai LI\nAssociate Professor\nCity University of Hong Kong\nView Speaker's Website\nDr. Lishuai Li is an Associate Professor in the School of Data Science at City University of Hong Kong.

  "text": "Organiser\nDepartment of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI)\nDeadline for registration: 3:00pm, 22 Mar 2023\nSummary\nSocial events such as massive protests are likely to turn into social conflicts by some triggers, leading to critical issues for urban governance and society stability. A quantitative understanding of their spatiotemporal patterns, including that how a protest is triggered, how a protest is propagating over time and over geography, what factors may influence the location of a protest occurring, etc., could help urban governors make better decisions for protecting citizens and make effective urban sustainable policies. Social media has been a popular venue for sharing such information before, during and after the social events. By analyzing not only the textual information but the tagged geoinformation involved in a massive social media dataset related to the events, one can investigate the key components of the events. Hence, this work focuses on applying a data-driven framework to a geo-tagged twitter dataset collected for the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests as a case study. We explore the features of the data through the lens of a set of quantitative analyses such as sentiment analysis, time series analysis and spatial analysis, trying to capture the underlying spatiotemporal patterns of the protests and their violent conflicts.\nPoster\nKeynote Speaker\nProf. Wei HUANG\nTongji University\nProf. Wei Huang is a Professor at the College of Surveying and Geo-informatics, Tongji University, China, and an Adjunct Professor at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), Canada.

  "text": "A group of students from LSGI2S03 recently embarked on a service learning program in Cambodia, where they spent a week volunteering in different communities across the country. The program, organized in partnership with local NGOs and community leaders, aimed to provide students with a unique cultural immersion experience while also making a positive impact in the lives of Cambodians.\nDuring their stay, the students participated in a range of activities, including rural area planning workshops, map making, UAV mapping, and weather & water samples collection and organizing educational and recreational programs for children. They also learned about the history, culture, and traditions of Cambodia through visits to museums, temples, and other cultural sites.\nOne of the highlights of the program was the opportunity to work with a local organization that supports young people affected by poor living environment. The students helped to organize a workshop on disease prevention and awareness, which was attended by dozens of young Cambodians. Through interactive sessions and discussions, the students were able to share their knowledge and experiences, while also learning from the local participants.\nReflecting on their experience, the students said that the program had a profound impact on their lives. \"We came to Cambodia hoping to make a difference, but we ended up learning just as much from the people we met,\" said Kris Tsang. \"We were struck by the resilience and warmth of the Cambodian people, and we feel privileged to have had the opportunity to contribute to their communities in some small way.\"\nThe program also received praise from local leaders and NGOs, who expressed their appreciation for the students' efforts. \"The students showed a great deal of dedication and enthusiasm during their time here, and their contributions will have a lasting impact on the communities they worked with,\" said Mr. Vatanak, director of Living Water Farm.\nService learning programs like this one provide students with a unique opportunity to learn about other cultures and make a positive impact in the world. As the students return home, they hope to inspire others to get involved in similar initiatives and continue making a difference in the lives of people around the globe.",

  "text": "The Global Geophysical Fluids Center (GGFC) was established by the International Earth Rotation Service, now the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) on IERS's 10th anniversary day January 1, 1998, in an effort to expand IERS's services to the scientific community. Under GGFC, eight Special Bureaus (SB) were originally selected, each to be responsible for research activities relating to a specific Earth component or aspect of the geophysical fluids of the Earth system. The GGFC was later restructured into three operational Special Bureaus (for the atmosphere, ocean and hydrology) and a non-operational center for models of the core, mantle, and tides. The Special Bureau for Hydrology (SBH) is responsible to coordinate research activities related to continental water. The main goals are: \nTo collect and distribute data sets and numerical model results related to the changing distribution of water over the planet, especially over land, that are of interest to the geodetic community. Geodetically interesting applications include estimating changes in the gravity field, geocenter, earth rotation, and load deformation of geodetic sites. These variations are of direct interest to the IERS and the community which it serves in the interpretation of earth rotation changes, improved definition of the terrestrial reference frame, and improvements in the quality of geodetic observations. \nSBH Main Objectives:\nTo focus on data sets and model results which provide generally complete global measures of water mass redistribution. Regional or continental scale data sets may be of some interest, but the main focus will be global. \nTo provide global hydrological data in forms that will allow useful comparisons with geodetic variations, such as earth rotation and gravity field changes. \nTo provide global hydrological data in forms that will allow useful connections with model and data results from other GGF subcenters, especially atmosphere and ocean subcenters. \nTo develop working relationships with hydrological modeling groups, in order to compute geodetically interesting quantities directly during model computations. This will simplify and speed the use of improved hydrologic models, and may provide geodetic measures for evaluation such models.",

Today, the input and the data flow are completely digital and to a large extent automatic, the latter in part thanks to the recent developments in machine learning and deep learning. \nAfter a short introduction of photogrammetry and computer vision, an overview of current sensor systems for geospatial data acquisition as well as automatic data processing procedures, both for geometric and for sematic results, is given.

  "text": "Organiser\nDepartment of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI)\nDeadline for registration: 10:00am, 16 Mar 2023\nSummary\nTarget- or intensity-feature-based calibration has been extensively explored for in-situ calibration of terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs). The main drawbacks of those calibration approaches include the necessity of mounting physical targets in the scan area and the need for the presence of rich geometrical features allowing a feature-based distinction of different points in the point cloud. We propose an autonomous TLS calibration algorithm using planar patches that are ubiquitous in urban environments and can be found without manual preparation beforehand. The scanner calibration parameters are estimated and updated by minimizing the M3C2 normal distances between corresponding planar patches. Unlike target-or keypointbased approaches, only medium-resolution scan data is needed. A comprehensive set of calibration model parameters are estimated using scans acquired from multiple positions, thereby providing a further advantage over current keypoint-based approaches that estimate only two-face sensitive parameters. To increase speed and reduce memory consumption, we propose to execute the calibration using only parts of scan data from a single station. Studies with two high-precision scanners, Leica RTC360 and Z+F Imager 5016, show results consistent with the laborious target-based approach with improved precision. Similar two-face sensitive calibration performance to the target- and keypoint-based approaches has been achieved, but with only subsets of the point cloud using the proposed algorithm.\nPoster\nKeynote Speaker\nDr. Jing Qiao\nAssistant Professor \nTongji University\nDr. Jing Qiao is an assistant professor at the college of surveying and geo-informatics, Tongji University.

  "text": "Venue\nZ414 & Zoom (Hybrid) Map \nSpeaker\nProf. Kefei Zhang\nDeadline for registration: 3:00pm, 9 Jan 2023\nWater vapor is one of the most important parameters that can be used to investigate extreme weather events and climatic phenomena. Effective monitoring and analyses of the water vapor contents are of great significance for analysing various types of meteorological disaster events and climatic changes. On the other hand, the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), as a relatively newly emerged atmospheric sounding technique, has been widely applied to the sounding of atmospheric water vapor. The performance of the GNSS water vapor sounding technique has experienced unprecedented developments with the substantial strengthened “richness” of multi-frequency and multi-mode, as well as its global operation ability and the rapid deployment of wide-spread ground- and space-based infrastructures. All these offer strong data support and a great opportunity to advance our knowledge and an in-depth understanding of climate change and extreme weather events. This report presents the GNSS water vapor sounding fundamentals first, followed by the current status, recent international frontier developments and our latest research efforts in the area, including, but not limited to, the ground-, air- and space-based GNSS sounding techniques. First, the background and theory of the GNSS tropospheric sounding technique are comprehensively summarized. Then, the theory, technical features and major advancement of the GNSS-derived atmospheric products in the applications of climate analyses and extreme weather forecasting are presented. Finally, the challenges, opportunities and future prospectives in terms of the technique and its innovative applications of national and international significance are provided. \nProf. Kefei Zhang\nProfessor of China University of Mining and Technology\nHonorary Professor of RMIT University, Australia\nDr. Kefei Zhang, is a Fellow of The International Association of Geodesy (IAG).

  "text": "Deadline for registration: 10:00am, 9 Dec 2022\nThe July 2021 historical rainstorms in Henan resulted in server flooding, causing devastating loss of lives and damage. The event was so extreme that it’s maximum 1-hour rainfall sets a new hourly precipitation record for China. China also experienced persistent widespread heatwaves in the summer 2022, with the summer mean temperature setting a new record. These events occurred on the backdrop of global warming. This presentation will place those events in the context of global warming, covering the following aspects. The human emission of greenhouse gases has changed the global climate and climate change is already affecting every region on Earth, in multiple ways. Human influence has also changed China’s climate including weather and climate extremes. Both the 2021 Henan flooding and recent summer heatwaves would not have been so extreme (bad) without human-induced climate change. Past change will continue in the future, the magnitude of future change depends on the amount of future emission. Reducing emission to slow down climate change and adapting to future new climate are both important.\nDr. Xuebin Zhang\nSenior Research Scientist with Climate Research Division \nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada\nDr. Xuebin Zhang is Senior Research Scientist with Climate Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Cities and the myriad networks in which they are embedded have thus been placed at the center of regional integration agendas. This research benchmarks contemporary regional integration levels in the Horn of Africa by examining its cities’ connectivity in transport networks. To this end, we specify a composite network consisting of air/train/road connectivity and analyze cities’ eigenvector and betweenness centralities within these networks. We find that the importance of national spaces for inter-city connectivity is much more evident in the Horn of Africa than in other parts of the world, which is also visible in the peripheralization of cities in borderlands. We argue that the region’s connectivity needs to be understood from a multiscalar and multimodal perspective and provide a baseline against which the impact of future interventions aimed at enhancing city connectivity/regional integration can be examined.\nDr. Mingshu WANG\nSenior Lecturer (Associate Professor) \nUniversity of Glasgow, UK\nDr. Mingshu Wang is a Senior Lecturer (Tenured Associate Professor) of Geospatial Data Science at the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow.

  "text": "Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics\nSeeking detailed spatial and temporal human activity patterns about how citizens interact with their surrounding urban environments is critical to understanding how cities work. This presentation aims to show how we can develop computational geography approaches with geospatial social media Big Data to model and uncover unique human-urban environment interaction patterns. By incorporating complex network theory and large-scale mobility data, spatial networks are constructed to represent people’s activities when interacting with the urban environments. This presentation illustrates two case studies: (1) The first study depicts intriguing urban geography based on the collective spatial interaction patterns. Its findings provide an explicit explanation of how spatial proximity affects the interaction intensity across space. (2) The second study characterizes people’s daily activity patterns in the urban environment. By modeling the transitions in people’s daily activities as geographic context-aware mobility networks, this study reveals distinct and recurrent activity patterns, known as activity motifs, that form the fundamental elements embedded in complex human-urban environment interactions. Finally, this presentation discusses potential challenges and opportunities in adopting computational geography as a core component for a wider range of social science applications.\nDr Junjun YIN\nAssistant Research Professor\nPennsylvania State University, United States\nJunjun Yin is an Assistant Research Professor at the Social Science Research Institute and an ICDS Associate at the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, the Pennsylvania State University. Before joining Penn State, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He obtained his Ph.D. degree in Spatial Information Science from the Dublin Institute of Technology, Ireland, which is a field in conjunction with Computer Science and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). His research interests center on GIScience with a focus on understanding human dynamics in the urban environment. His main research agenda employs computational geography approaches and geospatial Big Data to model human-urban environment interactions and their applications to urban environmental sustainability, resilience, and mobility. One of his current research themes is using geo-located social media data as a geospatial Big Data source for addressing social problems and societal issues.",

  "text": "Multiscalar standardized drought indices, such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), have been commonly used in drought studies. These indices can reflect the standardized statistical deviation of a water component (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture) to its climatology at multiple time scales. In this study, we propose a multiscalar standardized terrestrial water storage index (STI) based on GRACE measurements to assess drought conditions. STI shows the statistical deficit of the integration of sub-surface and surface hydrological components (e.g., soil moisture and groundwater) as measured by terrestrial water storage from GRACE satellites. Because of the statistical nature of its definition, the proposed STI is comparable to other standardized drought indices such as SPI and SPEI across different regions at multiple time scales. Our comparisons of STI with other standardized drought indices and the GRACE-based drought severity index (DSI) show that STI can capture drought events with less noise than other indicators in persistent drought events. STI at short-term time scales (e.g., 3 and 6 months) have higher correlations with SPI/SPEI at long-term scales (e.g., 18 and 24 months), because STI is based on terrestrial water storage. STI is also better correlated with vegetation changes reflected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) than uni-scalar drought indices.\nDr. LI Jianfeng\nAssociate Professor in the Department of Geography\nDirector of the Centre for Geo-computation Studies\nHong Kong Baptist University\nDr. Jianfeng Li is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Director of the Centre for Geo-computation Studies of Hong Kong Baptist University.

Geomatics involves using techniques such as geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing to conduct spatial data analyses and aid decision-making. Students in the MSc program in Geomatics also study computer and mathematics courses to help them better understand GIS. The course also offers a wide range of options for career development as geomatics is also related to many different disciplines and applications, including smart cities and cartography.\nI undertook a Master of Science in Geomatics from 2020 to 2022. During my studies, I was taught by professional and enthusiastic teachers, who were happy to help whenever I experienced academic problems. They provided me with effective suggestions and encouragement, as well as guidance on future development directions. I also met many friendly classmates during my course. I highly recommend the MSc in Geomatics to those interested in learning about this topic and pursuing a related profession.\nHUI Pui Lam\nMSc in Geomatics",

  "text": "Degrees and Qualifications \nThe MSc programme in GIS and Surveying has been running for more than 17 years. Being the longest-running programme in its category, the programme is highly regarded by GIS and surveying professionals in Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific. By focusing on GIS and surveying technologies, students become familiar with the technical aspects of GIS and surveying operations and how they can be applied in a variety of industries including how results can be accurately interpreted. As such, graduates are employed in various disciplines.\nMSc Leaflet (Chinese version) / MSc Leaflet (English version)\nPoster (Chinese version) / Poster (English version)\nCareer Prospects / Academic Opportunities after Graduation\nThe application of GIS in Hong Kong and many other countries has increased rapidly in the last two decades and beyond just land surveying. Ten years ago, only two or three government departments in Hong Kong used GIS. Today, the list has grown to include the Lands Department, Planning Department, Highways Department, Transport Department, Fire Services Department, Civil Engineering and Development Department, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.\nIn the private sector, utilities such as gas and power companies have been frequent users. In recent years, telecommunications, planning, public administration, transportation, logistics, car navigation, civil engineering, archaeology and real estate companies have also adopted GIS in their operations. As such, new career opportunities arise for graduates from these postgraduate programmes.",

  "text": "Atmospheric water vapor is critically important in meteorology and many other areas. Water vapor arguably lies at the heart of all key terrestrial atmospheric processes. It plays a significant role in studies such as weather forecasting, hydrology, climate change, atmosphere science, to name a few. It can significantly degrade the accuracy of GNSS-based (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning and navigation.\nHowever accurate observation and modeling of atmospheric water vapor have long been a challenge in the meteorological and other communities. Recently one book titled “Tomographic Reconstruction of Atmospheric Water Vapor Field and Its Potential Applications” has been published by the Press of Central South University. The publication of this book represents a climax of the decade-long research work that has been conducted at Dr. George Liu’s Micro-Laboratory of Atmospheric Research and Geomatics Engineering (Micro-LARGE) at the Department of Land Surveying & Geo-Informatics (LSGI), the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).\nIn addition to the introduction of fundamentals of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) meteorology as well as various atmospheric water vapor models and observation techniques, this book has presented many advanced algorithms to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) distribution of atmospheric water vapor accurately. The applications of the 3D tomographic modeling results in studies of severe weather events, atmospheric river, and GNSS Precise Point Positioning have also been demonstrated.\nThis 203-page book was coauthored by Dr. Biyan Chen, a former PhD graduate at the Micro-LARGE Lab, Dr. George Liu, Prof. Wujiao Dai, and Prof. Lixin Wu. Dr. Chen currently is working as an associate professor at the Central South University, the same institution as Profs. Dai and Wu. Dr. Chen was the first one at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) to receive the “Zhu Kezhen” Prize awarded by the Hong Kong Meteorological Society in 2017.",

  "text": "On 16 August 2022, thirty secondary school students joined PolyU Summer Programme held by Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI) at Geomatics Computing Laboratory of PolyU LSGI. The Programme is designed to give secondary school students a taste of various PolyU disciplines, and to better prepare them for their future academic pursuits.\nThis programme was held online for the last 2 years. This year, we are delighted that we can arrange a face-to-face one to meet and communicate with all participants, so as to give them a better understanding on our discipline and areas of application. On behalf of LSGI, Dr Sissi Chen, Teaching Fellow and Deputy Programme Leader of LSGI’s BSc programme, welcomed the participants and shared the Digital Roadmap of Hong Kong. Her talk also covered the introduction of Geographic Information System (GIS) and different spatial applications which are followed by a hands-on CSDi & GIS workshop. Students can experience how to analyze different geo-spatial data to meet the social needs. \nLast but not the least, students visited our laboratories to understand the equipment and technologies of LSGI as well as our profession. Certificates were presented to participants for completion of programme by Dr Xiaolin Zhu, Associate Professor and Programme Leader of our BSc programme, at the end of programme.",

  "text": "Frequently Asked Questions \nOur Mother Land manifests itself in shapes within and beyond our imagination. Some are natural like mountain, river, and oceans. Many are man-made, like roads, bridges, buildings, and rest are invisible, like ground water, geology and utilities. Their positions, dimensions and conditions are ever changing, and impact our natural and human landscapes, and of course generations of livelihood.\nHow do we know, and how do we understand these changes? For thousands of years till now, we look upon the stars, navigate across the seven Oceans, and create maps and symbols for descriptions. We have been building land surveying tools to observe, measure to obtain DATA and transform them to useful INFORMATION. Tools can be simple ones like ruler, telescope, and can be complicated ones like laser scanner, satellite images, GPS, hydrographic sonars, radar, seismic geo-phones, etc. In LSGI, we transform collected data to information, to help understand the terrestrial ground, subsurface ocean and underground by making maps (Google map is an example) for town planning, design, construction and maintenance of infrastructures, urban hazard mitigation. For this, students will learn multi-disciplinary knowledge from geography, maths, computers and physics, and are expected to be the technology frontier of the survey discipline.\nAs the ONLY such education provider in this specific discipline in Hong Kong, our graduates are employed by the Government and various private sectors like consultants and contractors. Some examples are Survey and Mapping Office (SMO) of Lands Department employing over 30% of our graduates as land surveying graduates, other examples are Highways Department, Planning Department (town planning), Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Department (tree survey), Transport Department (Traffic flow and route analysis).\nWhat is the difference between land surveying and other surveying such as Building surveying? \nBuilding surveying focuses on the monitoring and management of building; quantity surveying is about procurement, cost control and risk management of construction projects; General practice surveying is about land and property acquisition. Land surveying includes part of building surveying but also includes the surveying of natural terrain and infrastructure. Our discipline makes use of cutting-edge technologies and instrumentation, it is also not limited to construction-related sector or city, but also spreads to regional scale (e.g. Pearl delta region) and even the entire Planet Earth.

We have been building land surveying tools to observe, measure to obtain DATA and transform them to useful INFORMATION. Tools can be simple ones like ruler, telescope, and can be complicated ones like laser scanner, satellite images, GPS, hydrographic sonars, radar, seismic geo-phones, etc. In LSGI, we transform collected data to information, to help understand the terrestrial ground, subsurface ocean and underground by making maps (Google map is an example) for town planning, design, construction and maintenance of infrastructures, urban hazard mitigation. For this, students will learn multi-disciplinary knowledge from geography, maths, computers and physics, and are expected to be the technology frontier of the survey discipline.\nAs the ONLY such education provider in this specific discipline in Hong Kong, our graduates are employed by the Government and various private sectors like consultants and contractors. Some examples are Survey and Mapping Office (SMO) of Lands Department employing over 30% of our graduates as land surveying graduates, other examples are Highways Department, Planning Department (town planning), Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Department (tree survey), Transport Department (Traffic flow and route analysis).\nWhat is the difference between land surveying and other surveying such as Building surveying? \nBuilding surveying focuses on the monitoring and management of building; quantity surveying is about procurement, cost control and risk management of construction projects; General practice surveying is about land and property acquisition. Land surveying includes part of building surveying but also includes the surveying of natural terrain and infrastructure. Our discipline makes use of cutting-edge technologies and instrumentation, it is also not limited to construction-related sector or city, but also spreads to regional scale (e.g. Pearl delta region) and even the entire Planet Earth.

Well-structured knowledge delivery, field trips, general subjects and work-integrated education all gave me opportunities to understand and access the professional field of surveying and geo-informatics. Benefiting from the low student-to-teacher ratio, we were able to build a rapport with each other and with the professors, who were willing to answer our questions and mentor us during our research and final year projects. My international exchange to Melbourne, Australia and several other overseas study trips broadened my horizons as a global citizen and equipped me with the capacity for critical and innovative thinking. Thank you, LSGI! Fortunately, I had decided on my research interests and career plan before I graduated. I have no doubt that I would choose LSGI as my major if I had to go back and attend university again.\nLI Jingyan (2019 Graduate)\nSub Title of The item",

  "text": "We are pleased to share that LSGI PhD graduate Dr. Jia He, Gail received the “Faculty Award for Outstanding PhD Thesis” by Faculty of Construction and Environment (FCE) in 2022. Under the supervision of Prof. George Liu, Dr. He completed her PhD with thesis “Enhancing the accuracy of water vapour retrieval from remote sensing observations using ground-based GNSS data” in 2021 at the Micro-Laboratory of Atmospheric Research and Geomatics Engineering (Micro-LARGE), the Department of Land Surveying & Geo-Informatics (LSGI).\nDr. He focuses on developing cutting-edge techniques to calibrate the atmospheric water vapor products from various remote sensing satellites. Her novel algorithms are arguably the first of its kind to beautifully link ground-based GPS/GNSS water vapor data with satellite-based remote sensing ones. The accuracy of remote sensing satellites’ water vapor products is remarkably improved, after being calibrated by using the non-physical model developed. For instance, her verification in North America (a large geographical area) shows that the root-mean-squares error (RMSE) of water vapor products calculated from MODIS/Terra satellite has reduced by 48.12% to 2.362 mm when using two-channel ratio transmittance and has reduced by 50.74% to 2.243 mm when using three-channel ratio transmittance. The algorithm and model Dr. He developed is accurate, reliable, and robust. It has been extensively validated with multi-year water vapor data collected from China, Australia, and North America from different satellites, covering both North and South Hemispheres.\nThe scientific impact and practical value of Dr. He’s work is significant. The atmospheric water vapor is the largest and the most important greenhouse gas (GHG) source in the atmosphere, accounting for about two-thirds of the GHG effects (much larger than the well known CO2). The water vapor is critically important in meteorology and many other areas. Water vapor arguably lies at the heart of all key terrestrial atmospheric processes. It plays a significant role in studies such as weather forecasting, hydrology, climate change, atmosphere science, GPS/GNSS/Beidou satellite positioning and navigation, InSAR satellite remote sensing, and many satellite-based Earth Observation Systems (EOS), to name a few. Without the correction of water vapor effect, all the satellite-based systems such as GPS/GNSS/Beidou, InSAR, and others EOS would suffer a large error in their results, e.g. an error up to a few meters in the GPS/GNSS/Beidou positioning and navigation.\nFCE annually awards the outstanding thesis according to the research impact. Dr. He published five journal papers in peer-reviewed top international journals with an average impact factor of 9.27 (as of September 2022). Dr. He is the 6th recipient from LSGI since this award was established in 2011. She is also the 3rd recipient from the Micro-LARGE Lab supervised by Prof. Liu.\nCongratulations Dr. He!",
