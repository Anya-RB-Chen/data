  "text": "Air pollution is the greatest environmental health risk factor for premature deaths worldwide. Among all air pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the deadliest. Since PM2.5 is a cocktail of components from a mix of sources and not all components or sources are equally toxic, research on the toxic components and their associated sources responsible for PM2.5 health effects plays a key part in air quality management.\nThe project, titled “Unravelling the Black Box between Air Pollution and Public Health for Transformative Air Quality Management”, is co-led by\nProf. Xiang-dong Li, Dean of Faculty of Construction and Environment (FCE), Director of Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development (RISUD), Chair Professor of Environmental Science and Technology; and Prof. Ko Jan Ming, Professor in Sustainable Urban Development. It has been awarded HK$44.5 million worth of funding by the Research Grants Council (RGC) Theme-based Research Scheme (TRS) 2022/23 (Twelfth Round).\nAs the project coordinator, Prof. Li will lead a multi-disciplinary team of 10 researchers from PolyU, CityU, CUHK, HKU and HKUST. The project is expected to generate solid evidence of key PM2.5 toxic components and emission sources that contribute to the acute toxicity of PM2.5, particularly in the exacerbation of two index diseases of the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischemic heart disease (IHD).\nFurthermore, the research team will evaluate the benefits and costs of their proposed strategy of targeting the sources of PM2.5 toxic constituents against the conventional approach targeting total mass concentrations when formulating air quality management policies. Effective, practical, and economical approaches to managing air quality and public health will be recommended. For example, the completion of the current project may lead to 1) a revision of the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) algorithm and the associated “Health Advice”; and 2) a review and update of the Air Quality Objectives (AQO) in Hong Kong. The experience in Hong Kong may also serve as a case model for the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and ultimately for the global community.",

  "text": "Current Students \nTeaching and Learning \nUniversity's Strategies on Education and Student Development\nEducation-To further enhance the academic strength of all our programmes and co-curricular activities, and to provide a holistic education which is outcome-based, work-integrated, professionally and globally-oriented, and student-centred. Students will be provided with greater flexibility to choose their areas of study so as to maximize the benefits of their learning and enhance their competitiveness. \nStudent Development-To strengthen the holistic development of students, particularly in the areas of global outlook, interest in local and international affairs, problem solving, critical and creative thinking, communication and interpersonal skills, sense of social and national responsibility, cultural appreciation, lifelong learning, biliteracy and trilingualism, entrepreneurship, teamwork and leadership.\nCEE Teaching and Learning Methods\nBy adopting an outcome-oriented approach, the primary objective of the implemented teaching and learning methods is to ensure that students attain critical thinking and all-roundedness with professional competence defined by the programme outcomes. In particular, they are tailored to develop abilities to apply knowledge to solving real-life engineering and scientific problems. Students work individually or in small groups depending upon the nature of the work involved. The group size varies according to the teaching and learning activity. Moreover, the idea of the 'active classroom,' entailing educational concepts and strategies that are relevant to the development of a high level of understanding of academic knowledge and functioning abilities, is advocated… Read MoreHide\nAll graduates of this department will attain:\nAn ability to communicate logically and lucidly;\nAn ability to present ideas and arguments verbally in formal presentations and informal discussions;\nAn ability to work with others in group work, and take responsibility for an agreed area of a shared activity;\nCritical and creative thinking and an ability to work independently;\nA recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning;\nAn ability to understand and abide by professional, ethical and social responsibilities.\nAcademic Advising\nAcademic advising aims to help students to make informed and intelligent academic decisions/choices about their study that suit their intellectual, professional and personal goals. It is instrumental to promoting student success, and plays a vital role in enhancing students' overall learning experience at the University.\nAll full-time undergraduate students of the Department will be assigned an Academic Advisor. Students are advised to meet their advisors face-to-face at least once every semester.",

  "text": "Introduction\nThe PolyU Global Student Exchange is an exchange programme for undergraduates. Since 2006, the Department also commenced their departmental exchange arrangement with various partner universities around the world, such as Imperial College of London, Seoul National University, The Catholic University of America, The University of Illinois, Chicago, and University of Calgary. The number of exchange students over the years is showed in the following graph.\nStudents who participate in the exchange programme will benefit not only from enhancing educational experiences but also awareness of multi-culture and improving language skills. Meanwhile, Sponsorship and Hardship Fund are available for eligible exchange students.\nEligibility\nFull-time PolyU non-final year undergraduate students with Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.7 or above.\nFluent in English or Putonghua (meeting the minimum language requirements of the host institution).\nIndependent, outgoing, flexible, sociable.\nActive participation in extra-curricular activities. \nApplication\nStudents are required to submit their application to the Department via the online platform.\nAll short-listed applicants may be invited for an interview.\nNominations will be made through the Global Engagement Office.\nApplication through the Global Engagement Office will be processed for a minimum of eight weeks before receiving the formal acceptance letter from the host institution.\nCredit Transfer\nStudents shall choose subjects from the overseas institution (“the overseas subjects”) for pre-approval of credit transfer (“the pre-approval”) by the Department.\nStudents shall ensure that the pre-approval has been properly completed before committed to the overseas study.\nStudents shall select the overseas subjects according to the curriculum stipulated in the Definitive Programme Document (or commonly known as Programme Scheme). Otherwise, eligibility for graduation could be adversely affected (i.e. delay).\nStudents who apply for the exchange programme in semester 1 only will be approved only if the following two conditions are met: \nStudents should resume study at the PolyU on or before the commencement day of the Semester 2; and\nThe host University agrees to deliver their examination papers and let the students to sit for the examinations at the PolyU if the examination period of the host University falls behind the commencement of the Semester 2 of the PolyU. This part will be confirmed by the host University through the assistance of the International Affairs Office.\nRegarding the credit transfer approval, students must go through the pre-approval process. In addition, the final credit transfer approval (no matter transfer for credits and/or grades) is subject to the grades attained by the student in the host University. Only grades equivalent to “fair / satisfactory / adequate” level or above will be approved. Grades with conditions, e.g. marginal pass / barely inadequate / less satisfactory” or etc will not be approved.\nFor students who join the exchange programme for full year with the same institution, both subject credits earned and subject grade attained will be recognized, if the credit transfer application is approved. For students who join the exchange programme for one semester with the same institution, only subject credits earned will be recognized, if the credit transfer application is approved.\nStudent Sharing Session\nCEE strongly encourages our students to participate in exchange programme as a part of their all-rounded development. By joining an exchange programme, students will be immersed in the language and culture of their chosen country and gain skills in inter-cultural learning and understanding. Most importantly, prospective employers in almost every field look favorably upon experience gained while living overseas and knowledge obtained of another language and culture.\nAlbert CHEN, student of BEng (Hons) Civil Engineering\n\"At the third year of my study, I was given a chance to be an exchange student at Imperial College London, one of our prestigious counterparts in the UK. It was definitely one of the most fascinating and fruitful experiences in my life. I was in a class of around 90 students from 22 different countries and the interaction with them was striking. I learned different cultures and got to know the state of development of the construction industry in different countries which made me realize that there are so many opportunities worldwide.\" \nZHU Zimo, student of BEng (Hons) Civil Engineering\n\"The exchange experience at the University of Leeds is surely a once in a lifetime opportunity of exploring a completely different culture. It has allowed me to widen my perspective and become self-sufficient. Deeply attracted by the British culture, I now make up my mind to pursue my career in the field of structural engineering in the UK. The communication skills I have got during my exchange in Leeds will definitely benefit me in both my study and career. I am now much more confident and my world has expanded significantly. I can see a bright future ahead of me.\"",

  "text": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has been approved by the State Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to establish two Hong Kong Branches of Chinese National Engineering Research Centres (CNERCs), namely the Hong Kong Branch of National Rail Transit Electrification and Automation Engineering Technology Research Centre and Hong Kong Branch of National Engineering Research Centre for Steel Construction. In the next three years, each branch will receive a funding support of a maximum amount of HK$5 million per year from the Innovation and Technology Commission as well as a dollar-to-dollar matching fund from PolyU to support its research and development for benefits of the Mainland and Hong Kong\nDelighted with this achievement, PolyU Vice President (Research Development), Ir Professor Ping-kong Alexander Wai said, “The Hong Kong Branches serve as key components of CNERCs. The approval of two Hong Kong Branches of CNERCs by MOST manifests recognition of the R&D capability of our research teams as well as our previous successful technology transfer experiences in the areas of rail engineering and steel construction. In the future, the two Hong Kong Branches will work closely with their mainland counterparts, and leverage on the respective strengths of both sides to promote applied research and development projects conducive to both the Mainland and Hong Kong.”\nHong Kong Branch of National Rail Transit Electrification and Automation Engineering Technology Research Centre\nIn recent years, the PolyU multi-disciplinary research team has established close partnership with the National Rail Transit Electrician and Automation Engineering Technology Research Centre at Southwest Jiaotong University to conduct joint research on high speed rail in China, making significant contributions to technology innovation and transfer in the industry.\nProfessor Ni Yiqing, Head of Hong Kong Branch, and Professor of PolyU’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, said, “The establishment of the Hong Kong Branch shall provide a high-level platform to strengthen the collaboration between the Mainland and Hong Kong on China’s high speed rail.”\nThe Hong Kong Branch is dedicated to becoming a world-class smart rail technology research centre. It will focus on developing advanced rail technologies to enhance the safety, reliability and comfort of China’s high speed rail. Three research laboratories will be established under the branch, namely Research Laboratory for High Speed Rail Traction Power System and Safety Technology, Research Laboratory for Advanced Sensing Techniques for High Speed Rail Monitoring, and Research Laboratory for Condition Monitoring and Vibration Control of High Speed Trains. The laboratories will carry out comprehensive and in-depth research on the monitoring, analysis, and assessment of high speed rail and the development of more intelligent protection and control technology.\nProf. Ni Yi-qing\nPhone: (852) 2766 6004 \nEmail: yiqing.ni@polyu.edu.hk\nHong Kong Branch of National Engineering Research Centre for Steel Construction\nAccording to the statistics provided by the World Steel Association, the annual steel production of China increased steadily over the past decade, reaching 822.7 mmt in 2014 and contributing 50.3% of the global annual steel production.\nProfessor Chung Kwok Fai, Head of the Hong Kong Branch, and Associate Head of PolyU’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering pointed out that, “China is the largest steel producing country in the world and she is also producing a wide range of high performance steel materials. However, the international market is not familiar with the engineering design and applications of these materials. The branch will work closely with the construction industry of Hong Kong to build an international technological platform for steel construction in order to showcase the technological advancement of the Chinese steel construction industry to the world and promote a wide use of Chinese steel materials in the international market.” The Hong Kong Branch will focus on two major research areas, namely sustainable infrastructure development and structural engineering on modern steel construction.\nAs anticipated by the China Iron and Steel Association, the annual export of Chinese steel materials and steel structures will grow to HK$345.6 billion to HK$518.4 billion in the coming 5 to 8 years. With 5% of professional engineering services being provided by Hong Kong construction industry, it is expected to generate an extra income ranging from HK$17.3 billion to HK$25.9 billion.\nPress Contacts\nProf. Chung Kwok-fai\nPhone: (852) 2766 6063\nEmail: kwok-fai.chung@polyu.edu.hk",

  "text": "Dr. Wang received his academic and professional trainings in both construction management and pavement engineering. Therefore, his teaching and research experiences have covered a variety of topics in these two broad disciplines. Under construction management, Dr. Wang is experienced in both building and roadway construction. His research projects and outcomes involve different topics related to project management. In recent years, his research interests in construction management are more focused on suitability issues of infrastructures. Example topics include carbon emissions in infrastructure construction and operation, life-cycle cost analysis, life-cycle assessment, life-cycle social impact analysis, and the interactions of infrastructures with environment, human society, and biodiversity. His most recent research endeavors are “nature-based solutions”—trying to incorporate nature-inspired and nature-friendly engineering solutions to traditional infrastructure construction and operation. You may refer to Nature-based Infrastructure Solutions for more details. \nDr. Wang’s research on pavement engineering started with his PhD study on pavement management. Since then, he has conducted numerous pavement-related research projects, ranging from pavement structure design, quality control/quality assurance, pavement materials, to pavement maintenance and preservation. His most recent research endeavors in pavements are focused on three areas: (1) asphalt materials, (2) smart roads, and (3) gaseous and particulate pollutants in pavement construction and their health impacts. The most noteworthy research achievements under pavement materials is that Dr. Wang’s team developed advanced microscopy techniques to characterize asphalt at the molecular level and nanoscale. They discovered the unique morphologies of asphaltenes and found that nearly all engineering properties of asphalt binders can be well predicted by nanoscale binder characteristics. Funded by a competitive and prestigious Research Impact Fund, Dr. Wang’s research team has also been developing new solutions for smart roads, including pavement noise reduction through 3D-printing assisted texture optimization, road-based positioning for autonomous vehicles, solar roads, roads built with Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), and other innovative technologies. Asphalt pavement construction produces harmful gaseous and particulate pollutants. It is very challenging to quantitatively analyze the pollutants and assess their health impacts. His team has been continuously developing reliable analytical methods to analyze such pollutants. You may refer to Pavement Research Highlights for more details.",

  "text": "Dr Alessandro Stocchino \nDoctor of Philosophy in Hydraulic Engineering, University of Padua\nResearch Interests\nMy background is primarily in applied fluid mechanics, turbulence and mass transport. I had a long training in mathematical modelling and laboratory techniques. My research interest can be summarized as follows: \nMass transport and Mixing Processes. \nI have been interested in this topic since the beginning of my PhD and, in these years, I have studied these processes either theoretically and experimentally. I have applied these concepts in several fields (environmental flows, bio-fluid mechanical applications such as the human eye and vascular diseases), which can be studied under common theoretical frameworks. \nI am currently devoted to apply the most updated Lagrangian mixing measures (Finite time and Space Lyapunov exponents, Lagrangian Coherent Structures) in several geophysical context. Another hot topic of this line of research is the analysis of how micro-plastic is transported in marine environment. The pollution transport, including micro-plastic is the object of two European Interreg Projects that have been funded in these months. \nCoastal and Estuarine circulation, Coastal Management \nDirectly connected to the previous topic, in these last two years our group has established a strong collaboration with important national and international research centres that control the Mediterranean HF-Radar coastal network, with the aim to investigate coastal circulation and several environmental issues. Indeed, the HF-radar data have been used in order to evaluate the dispersion properties of the circulation. These topics are carried out in synergy with the Maritime Authorities with the future goal to develop prevention measures and rapid response tools against marine pollution. Coastal circulation studies are also carried out using open source numerical models widely used in this field (DELF-3D, ROMS). \nRiver Hydro-Morphodynamics \nIn several studies I have applied the stability linear and weakly non-linear theories with the aim to investigate the formation of small and meso-scale river bedforms (ripples, dunes and antidunes). As a research group, we have an internationally recognized expertise in river restoration and river morphodynamics. Besides, the theoretical studies, we have a deep knowledge of several numerical models commonly used for steady and unsteady flow simulations. The results have been collected in a series of scientific papers. \nFlood risk Management \n1D and 2D numerical modelling is a powerful tools to be applied in river engineering in order to study the flooding risk and its mitigation measures. This line of research is the focus of one of the European project that started in 2017. \nBio-fluid mechanics. \nI have dedicated many years to the study of the human vitreous dynamics induced by eye movements and its relationship with several retinal diseases. I have been in charge mainly of the experimental activities of these researches. We based our works on the in-vitro experiments reproducing the vitreous chamber and its rotations with detailed physical models. We then applied the most sophisticated measuring techniques (Particle Image Velocimetry) to quantify the vitreous motion and its effects on the retina, mostly evaluating the mechanical stresses. Our group in collaboration with a surgical unit tested also the applicability of the Particle Image Velocimetry in-vivo in order to characterise the status of the vitreous of the patient. In fact, we have analysed a series of ultrasound recordings with the same technique of the PIV, which in this case is known as US_PIV, and measure the velocities of the vitreous during controlled eye movements. This non-invasive technique is a promising method for a direct evaluation of several vitreous and retinal diseases. \nMoreover, the laboratory activities aimed to investigate the drug delivery via direct injection within the vitreous chamber. Our group is internationally recognized as one of the main centre for the human vitreous dynamics studies. Recently, I coordinate a starting project on the fluid mechanical aspects of the vitrectomy, in particular, analysing the performance of different vitreous cutters and their possible effects on the retina. Most of the research has been developed in strict collaboration with ophthalmologists and retinal surgeons. ",

  "text": "Dr Wang Peng \nDoctor of Philosophy, University of California\nResearch Interests\nWater security represents one of the major challenges to the sustainable development of human society. However, rapid population growth, steadily improving living standards, climate change, and environmental pollutions place enormous pressures on already stressed water resource systems. In addition, large amounts of energy are consumed to produce clean water and to treat wastewaters prior to their return to the environment, which inevitably leads to a considerable amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Developing sustainable energy driven water production systems that enable a sustainable and cost-effective strategy for water production would benefit both developing and developed countries alike, and address one of the outstanding challenges of the 21st century: how to provide a safe and reliable source of water for a growing global population. \nThe principal goal of our group research is to deliver clean water with a minimum carbon footprint and energy cost via the design and application of advanced technologies. Our group is alway very passionate at technologies which can facilitate the world to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6). \nSpecific Research Interests: \nPV-MD for decentralized fresh water production and eletricity (video) \nWaste heat driven processes for clean water production \nSolar crystallization based brine treatment and desalination with zero liquid discharge (ZLD) \nWater vapor sorbent for atmospheric water harvest and energy-related applications (e.g., smart cooling and energy conversion) \nResource recovery from wastewaters, brine, and seawater \nElectrochemical processes for environmental applications \nEnvironmental nanotechnology \nMembrane separation ",

Lam has over 40-year professional experience and has worked extensively in Hong Kong and China for research and consultancy projects on traffic engineering, transport planning and modeling, ranging from strategic transport planning for the Territory to traffic impact assessments for local areas (including economic and environmental evaluation). Ir Prof. Lam has been involved in various transport planning and infrastructure projects. In December 2015, he was invited by Ove Arup & Partners Hong Kong Limited to serve as an Independent Technical Advisor for the Detailed Feasibility Study for Environmental Friendly Linkage System (EFLS) for Kowloon East (http://www.ktd.gov.hk/efls/). In April 2014, Ir Prof. Lam was invited by Hong Kong Construction Association to conduct a green transport study for new development areas in Hong Kong. \nto comment on the minimum extent of temporary reclamation in relation to the length of the preferred alignment of CKR being the shortest and complying with the relevant highway design standards (see website: http://www.ckr-hyd.hk/pdf/044-02_English(Combined).pdf).\nIn May 2011, Ir Prof. Lam was invited by the Drainage Projects Division, Drainage Services Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government to serve as an Independent Assessor for review of the \nIr Prof. Lam has been served as the Chairman of the Briefing Sessions with the North Point Residents on 14 and 15 April 2007 regarding the issue on the Eastern Ventilation Building for the Central-Wan Chai Bypass and Island Eastern Corridor Link.\nIr Prof. Lam has also been invited by the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (http://www.uncrd.or.jp/) to serve as an expert and moderator for facilitating the Asian Mayors’ Policy Dialogue for the Promotion of Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) in Cities from 23 to 24 April 2007 in Kyoto, Japan and for the 3rd EST Forum from 17 to 19 March 2008 in Singapore.\nIn 2005, Ir Prof. Lam has been appointed by the Hong Kong SAR Government to chair an Expert Panel for giving comments/recommendations on Sustainable Transport Planning and Central-Wan Chai Bypass. The Panel has held one open forum and five working group meetings from 24 August to 30 September, 2005 to consolidate public views and members’ recommendations on the captioned issues. A final report has been published in October 2005 and is available in the following website:\nhttp://www.harbourfront.org.hk/eng/content_page/doc/report_of_the_expert_panel.pdf\nIr Prof. Lam is also a pioneer for development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in Hong Kong. In the past 2 decades, with partnership of Autotoll Limited (www.autotoll.com.hk), he has developed novel solution algorithms for multiple ITS projects for the Transport Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government. The developed ITS applications include:\nSpeed Map Panels (SMP), which was launched in January 2013, display the estimated traffic speeds on various road segments by using different colours to represent different congestion levels together with the journey time estimates on the selected paths in the New Territories of Hong Kong.\nJourney Time Indication System (JTIS), which was launched to the public at the end of May 2010, provides the average journey times of selected paths once every two minutes via the on-gantry indicators in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula.\nHong Kong eRouting System (formerly named as “Driving Route Search Service (DRSS)”), which was launched in mid-2010, provides the latest traffic information to road users to search for the driving route by different criteria (such as the fastest, shortest or cheapest route). This system was integrated with the Hong Kong eMobility (www.hkemobility.gov.hk) since late 2020.\nInternet Speed Map, which was launched in January 2007, shows the traffic speeds in three colours for representing the levels of congestion of current traffic condition. The speed map is integrated with the Hong Kong eMobility (www.hkemobility.gov.hk) since August 2018.\nHis solution algorithm has addressed the challenges of ITS development in Hong Kong, at a time when commercial solutions are not adequately up to the challenge. Based on limited available traffic data from multiple sensor systems, real-time traffic information can be estimated accurately (https://www.polyu.edu.hk/kteo/polyu-innovations/list/4-smart-cities-and-information-technology/4_cee_01_0819/). In 2018, Ir Prof. Lam has participated in the project of Installation of Traffic Detectors on Selected Strategic Roads for the Transport Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government. In this project, over 500 traffic detectors will be installed on the strategic routes for collection of traffic data on real-time basis.\nJourney Time Indicator at Gascoigne Road, Kowloon\nSpeed Map Panel at Tuen Mun Road, Tuen Mun\nC(i) CONSULTANCY & CONTRACT RESEARCH PROJECTS\n1.

Refer to Appendix H for details.\nRecent Research Projects and Future Research Plans \nMore recently, Prof. Chung has extended his applied research interests into construction sustainability and durability of infrastructures. His interests include corrosion protection and galvanization, atmospheric corrosivity to exposed structural steelwork as well as sustainable steel construction in close collaboration with the iron and steel industry in China. Prof. Chung is dedicated to contribute proactively to the socio-economic development of Hong Kong, in particular, to the construction industry in facilitating the development of Hong Kong into a world class Centre for International Engineering Design of Infrastructures. \n6.1 Recent Research Projects\nWith the support of the construction industry, Prof. Chung had successfully secured the following two research projects on corrosion and corrosion protection of structural steelwork using hot-dip galvanization:\nMay 2010 to\nApr 2012\nEnhanced ductility and service life of galvanized structural steel members\nResearch funded by the Innovation and Technology Programme of the Innovation and Technology Funds under the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Government of Hong Kong SAR at HK$4,977,000 administrated by the Nano and Advanced Materials Institute.\nMay 2012 to\nOct 2013\nEnhanced durability and mechanical performance of structural steel members using an innovative galvanization process\nResearch funded by the University and Industry Collaboration Programme of the Innovative Technology Funds under the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Government of Hong Kong SAR at HK$2,416,300.\nProject Objectives:\n(1) To develop an innovative galvanization process to produce zinc-aluminum galvanization coatings with enhanced ductility and mechanical performance. While the Galfan technique is well established for galvanization of steel wires, cables and sheets through a ‘continuous galvanization’ process, the application of the technique to structural steel members requires a comprehensive research and development programme to modify the process into a ‘discrete galvanization.’\n(2) To compile a technical guidance on specification, inspection and quality assurance for the local construction industry in Hong Kong. It should be noted that the technical guidance will be provided to government departments and regulatory authorities to encourage direct adoption of the proposed method in construction projects. \n6.2 Future Research Plan\nSustainable Steel Construction\nAs President of the Hong Kong Constructional Metal Structures Association, Professor K F Chung has established professional collaboration with the following industrial associations in the Region since the establishment of the Association in July 2010:\nThe Singapore Structural Steel Society\nThe China Iron and Steel Association\nThe China Constructional Metal Structures Association\nThe China Steel Construction Society\nThe International Zinc Association\nThe Taiwan Institute of Steel Construction\nIn order to encourage sustainable steel construction in the Region, high performance constructional steel materials with excellent properties in strength, toughness, and resistances to fire and corrosion should be developed. Moreover, complementary technical guidance on design, construction, testing and quality control on the use of these high performance materials should also be developed under a joint collaborative effort in the Region through the international network of the Association:\n1 To develop high performance constructional steel in building structures\nHigh strength steel materials with good ductility.\nHigh corrosion and fire resistant strip steel materials\nStructural behavior of high strength steel members\n2 To promote the use of high performance steel materials in construction projects\nTo promote effective use of high performance steel materials in construction projects which are designed to BS 5950 and Eurocodes 3 and 4 with Eurocodes materials specifications.\nTo promote full adoption of Chinese steel materials among design and construction engineers, architects, as well as regulatory agents and other construction professionals in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Malaysia as well as countries in Asia and the Middle East.\n3 To disseminate knowledge on the use of international codes of practice\nTo introduce Eurocodes to designers, fabricators and material suppliers in Hong Kong, Macau, and major cities in China through seminars and training courses.\nTo compile a comprehensive set of self-learning materials on Eurocodes for practicing engineers.\nTo provide a Chinese version of the Steel Designers’ Manual 7th Edition which was recently updated in compliance with Eurocodes. \nIt is reckoned that wide adoption of high performance constructional steel S460, S690 and S960 will improve the constructability of infrastructures by 100 to 200%. This will provide huge savings in steel materials as well as labour costs (for fabrication and erection), transportation costs and many other associated costs. The construction professionals in Hong Kong should take advantage of the latest development in sustainable steel construction and position Hong Kong into a world class Centre for International Engineering Design of Infrastructures, through the effective use of high performance constructional steel in compliance with Eurocodes. \nAdditionally, it should be noted that China is currently the largest steel manufacturer in the world, producing over 40 to 55% of the world steel tonnages in the last five years. The development of a new market of high performance constructional steel in building structures in the Region will definitely have positive impacts to both the iron and steel industry and the steel construction industry in China. With the new markets for Chinese steel materials, steel manufacturers in China will be able to upgrade their production towards technologically advanced methods, which will also be environmental friendly. This should be taken as an important step for China to develop towards sustainable steel construction in the coming decades.",

Their achievement in education, research and outreach to the profession and society has been truly remarkable.\nI have had the privilege of associating with the Department for a long time. My association with CEE started with Professor Chi Sun Poon's and my joint interest in cement-based materials. He has pioneered studies on the utilization of waste materials. He has developed a unique approach to improve recycled concrete aggregate by using CO2, thus solving the issues of waste material and CO2 storage.\nI have collaborated with Professor Jian-Guo Dai for many years. I have been fortunate to work with him on topics including surface coating and ultra-high performance concrete. Both Professor Poon and Dai have been extensively involved with the industry, organizing international conferences and highly cited research papers. This is the hallmark of the CEE department. My colleagues at Northwestern University have been quite impressed with the excellent work conducted on the non-destructive evaluation of structures and structural health monitoring.\nCurrently, the faculty from the CEE department is extensively involved with the Theme Center (directed by President Teng) on utilizing seawater rather than drinking water for making concrete structures. This Center is making a global impact on sustainability. I am looking forward to continuing the excellence of the CEE department. The department's impact on society is truly outstanding.\nProf. Surendra P.

  "text": "It was some 30 years ago that I received a request from Mike Anson to consider appointment as External Examiner for the MSc course in Structures. I accepted and so began a long, rewarding (for me and I trust, for PolyU) and enjoyable association that has provided me with a unique perspective on the development of CEE through direct personal involvement in several capacities: p/g, u/g and PhD examiner, research collaborator, promotions advisor, visiting professor and friend. During that time CEE has been transformed from a largely teaching focused operation in a polytechnic into a fully functioning and highly successful university department - one that sits comfortably in my “top 10 in the world”. How has that been achieved? Initially, because of the vision and ambition of its early leaders, development through the appointment of able and energetic staff and, latterly, through recognition and exploitation of those opportunities that only come to those with the intellectual capability and collective ambition to be the best. It is no accident that PolyU’s current President arrived as a lecturer in CEE and progressed to become a Chair Professor.

  "text": "Event \nOrganiser\nCEE / HKIE Civil Division\nSummary\nDeep learning (DL) methods have emerged as one of the most popular and effective artificial intelligence algorithms for solving a range of problems in various industries. In geotechnical engineering, DL methods are becoming increasingly important for addressing complex issues. However, conventional DL methods have limitations in representing multi-level and sequential data, which are typical in geotechnical engineering. These limitations can lead to inaccurate and inefficient models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel REMSE loss function and an adaptive activation function tanhLU. These techniques are designed to address the differential performance on multi-level data and vanishing gradient problems. By understanding the underlying mechanisms of these problems, we were able to develop solutions that can significantly improve the performance of DL models in geotechnical engineering. During the talk, I will present several examples of how these improved DL methods can be used to model the monotonic stress-strain relationships of soils and sequential behaviours of shield tunnelling. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques and their potential for a range of applications in geotechnical engineering. Overall, the development of improved DL methods is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex phenomena in geotechnical engineering and solving important practical problems.\nKeynote Speaker\nDr Ning ZHANG\nResearch Assistant Professor",

  "text": "Ir. Dr. Shao-Yuan (Ben) Leu is currently an Associate Professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He obtained his BS/MS degrees on Wood Processing Techniques from the National Taiwan University (1993-97) and PhD from the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department of University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA (2003-09). He was a lecturer at UC Riverside (2010-11) and a postdoctoral fellow at USDA Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin (2011-13). Dr. Leu’s research interests are in biorefinery and biological systems for wastes and wastewater treatment and its valorization for new generation bioenergy and chemicals. He and other Professors in the Research Institute of Sustainable Development (RISUD) established the BioEnergy Lab, which aims to characterize the physiochemical properties of plant cell wall and forge biomass conversion theories into practices. From pretreatment, saccharification, fermentation, to lignin depolymerization, Dr. Leu’s team has developed a few techniques to convert plant biomass derived from woods, herbs, and even food wastes into useful products, such as bioethanol, 2,3-butandiols, and monolignols. The related studies may be particularly applicable for forestry and waste management in mega-cities like Hong Kong. \n- Shao-Yuan (Ben) Leu, Ph.D., P.E (California)\nResearch Interests \nOpen Positions\nThe Green Energy Research Group in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HK PolyU) is seeking for a few Postdoctoral Fellows, Research Assistants, and Student Helpers to support our recent project “New Solvent-Based Biorefinery Techniques to Extract Lignin from Timber Wastes for High Titer Biofuel Production”. The related research topics include, but not limiting to, designing and constructing biological processes and bioreactor for biofuels; “decoding” lignocellulosic plant cell wall structure with advanced technique (NMR, GC/MS) for efficient pretreatment; and/or synthesizing valuable chemicals from biomass extractives. Interested candidates should apply for the position by sending your Curriculum Vitae to Dr. Ben Leu via syleu@polyu.edu.hk. More details of the positions follow: \nPOSTDOCTORAL FELLOW\nPh.D. graduate in Bio-techniques, Plant Science, or Chemical/Environmental Engineering are welcome to submit your application. Our positions are highly completive. PolyU CEE Department ranked #2 in the world (US News 2022). PolyU has recently obtained a few sophisticated analytical tools for the related research, including a 3rd Generation DNA Sequencer and a 500 MHz solid-/liquid-state NMR. \nRESEARCH ASSISTANT\nCurrent B.S./M.S. Students or Graduate in Environmental, Chemistry, and Biology programs are both welcome to apply for the position. The main duties include supporting the experimental and field works, data analysis, and other related works upon the supervision of the research staff. The position can be either full-time or part-time; and the monthly salary. \nWatch On Youtube",

  "text": "Dr. Wang received his academic and professional trainings in both construction management and pavement engineering. Therefore, his teaching and research experiences have covered a variety of topics in these two broad disciplines. Under construction management, Dr. Wang is experienced in both building and roadway construction. His research projects and outcomes involve different topics related to project management. In recent years, his research interests in construction management are more focused on suitability issues of infrastructures. Example topics include carbon emissions in infrastructure construction and operation, life-cycle cost analysis, life-cycle assessment, life-cycle social impact analysis, and the interactions of infrastructures with environment, human society, and biodiversity. His most recent research endeavors are “nature-based solutions”—trying to incorporate nature-inspired and nature-friendly engineering solutions to traditional infrastructure construction and operation. You may refer to Nature-based Infrastructure Solutions for more details. \nDr. Wang’s research on pavement engineering started with his PhD study on pavement management. Since then, he has conducted numerous pavement-related research projects, ranging from pavement structure design, quality control/quality assurance, pavement materials, to pavement maintenance and preservation. His most recent research endeavors in pavements are focused on three areas: (1) asphalt materials, (2) smart roads, and (3) gaseous and particulate pollutants in pavement construction and their health impacts. The most noteworthy research achievements under pavement materials is that Dr. Wang’s team developed advanced microscopy techniques to characterize asphalt at the molecular level and nanoscale. They discovered the unique morphologies of asphaltenes and found that nearly all engineering properties of asphalt binders can be well predicted by nanoscale binder characteristics. Funded by a competitive and prestigious Research Impact Fund, Dr. Wang’s research team has also been developing new solutions for smart roads, including pavement noise reduction through 3D-printing assisted texture optimization, road-based positioning for autonomous vehicles, solar roads, roads built with Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), and other innovative technologies. Asphalt pavement construction produces harmful gaseous and particulate pollutants. It is very challenging to quantitatively analyze the pollutants and assess their health impacts. His team has been continuously developing reliable analytical methods to analyze such pollutants. You may refer to Pavement Research Highlights for more details.",

  "text": "I am currently the program leader of the civil engineering program of our Department. I serve in several scientific and professional committees. I am the executive board member of the Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies (HKSTS), international executive committee member of the International Committee on Pavement Technology (ICPT), international advisory committee member of Chinese and European Pavement Research Workshop, member of several mommittees in the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies. \nI dedicated most of my time in professional services to the editing of several journals. Please send your high-quality papers to the following journals. \nConstruction and Building Materials provides an international forum for the dissemination of innovative and original research and development in the field of construction and building materials and their application in new works and repair practice. The journal publishes a wide range of innovative research and application papers which describe laboratory and to a limited extent numerical investigations or report on full scale projects (link to the journal). \nNature-Based Solutions is a home to research of nature-based solutions (NBS), to both broaden and deepen scientific knowledge on NBS and advance its adoption, synthesis, and application to address critical societal challenges at multiple scales. NBS utilize nature and/or ecological processes to strengthen a system's capacity to deal with multiple and interconnected challenges. NBS represent a holistic approach to climate change adaptation and resilience building, with equal reliance upon social, environmental, and economic pillars (link to the journal). \nThe objective of the International Journal of Pavement Research and Technology is to provide a platform to promote exchange of ideas among pavement engineering communities around the world. The journal attempts to disseminate information on all aspects of pavement engineering and technology developed through research and practical experiences (link to the journal). \nSustainable and Resilient Infrastructure is an interdisciplinary journal that focuses on the sustainable development of resilient communities. Sustainability is defined in relation to the ability of infrastructure to address the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Resilience is considered in relation to both natural hazards (like earthquakes, tsunami, hurricanes, cyclones, tornado, flooding and drought) and anthropogenic hazards (like human errors and malevolent attacks.) Resilience is taken to depend both on the performance of the built and modified natural environment and on the contextual characteristics of social, economic and political institutions. Sustainability and resilience are considered both for physical and non-physical infrastructure (link to the journal).",

In 2008, I was awarded a research project entitled Improvement of Porous Pavement System for Onsite Stormwater Management by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). Since then, I have been working on several research projects related to porous materials and structures, sponsored Hong Kong Highways Department, European Commission--Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Horizon 2020 program), and Research Impacts Fund by Hong Kong Research Grants Council. We developed “a smart integrated road pavement and drainage system for stormwater storage, de-icing, dust suppression, and cooling.” This system won Canadian Special Awards and Organizer’s Choice Awards in the International Invention Innovation Competition in Canada (iCAN 2020). We are still developing new porous materials and structures. \nUrban heat island (UHI) effect is a well-known and extensively studied phenomenon. Excessive urban heat is expected to worsen with global climate change, and it adversely impacts the walkability of cities and health or residents. Funded by the European Commission--Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Horizon 2020 program), we evaluated different nature-based strategies to mitigate urban heat. \nWhile climate change is a pressing issue that attracts a lot of attention, another looming crisis is the rapid loss of biodiversity. According to the United Nations, one million out of eight million of the total estimated number of species on Earth are in the brink of distinction. Many scholars believe that we are in the process of the Sixth Extinction—a term used to describe the mass extinction of biological species on Earth by Elizabeth Kolbert. Unlike the previous extinction, however, the Sixth Extinction is created by humans. \nBiodiversity offers rich ecological services. It not only provides us food, construction materials, medicine, etc. but also helps regulate the climate and make human society more resilient. The construction and operation of infrastructures affect biodiversity. Funded by the European Commission--Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Horizon 2020 program), we tried to develop managerial and technical solutions to conserve biodiversity through ecologically friendly infrastructures. \nUrban runoffs are highly polluted. In Hong Kong, urban pavement runoffs are discharged into streams and rivers and flow into the sea. Urban infrastructures such as pavements, drainage pipes and channels all play a role in water quality. Funded by the European Commission--Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Horizon 2020 program), \nwe tried to understand quality water from urban pavement runoffs and evaluate water quality of river and streams. We also tried to evaluate the effectiveness of river restoration on water quality. In addition to conventional laboratory water quality tests, innovative IoT-based sensing system is used to automatically monitor water quality, along with bioindicators such as EPT (E= Ephemeroptera, P= Plecoptera, T= Tricoptera). \nRapid urbanization causes city expansion. However, it remains a challenge to balance the competing demands of environmental conservation, economic development, and societal needs. Based on a national natural reserve in China, Hengshui Lake Natural Reserve, we developed a framework of translating general sustainable development principles into specific practices at the regional level. We tried to use multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques such as the analytic network process (ANP) to weigh the evaluation criteria and rank the proposed capital and social development projects. In this research direction, we try to incorporate techniques from project management and management science into infrastructure project development with the goal of promoting sustainable development at different dimensions.",

  "text": "Reinvent membranes at the nexus of novel material, structural redesign, and fabrication approach\nMembrane separation is one key process in advanced water treatment due to various technical advantages such as small footprint, high separation efficiency, and relatively affordable costs. However, their more widespread applications are hindered by several technical challenges such as a trade-off between permeability and selectivity, fouling, and low chlorine resistance, among others. These challenges can be effectively addressed by developing a new generation of membranes, enabled by the use of novel membrane materials, the redesign of membrane structure, and the engineering of advanced fabrication approaches. We are actively exploring the assembly of emerging membrane building blocks (such as carbon and catalytic nanomaterials, polyelectrolytes) into novel membrane structures (mixed matrix or layer-by-layer assembly), assisted by new scalable aerosol-assisted printing approaches. Our current research has been focused on the development of nanocomposite ultrafiltration (UF) and polyelectrolyte multilayer nanofiltration (PEM NF) membranes.",

Refer to Appendix H for details.\nRecent Research Projects and Future Research Plans \nMore recently, Prof. Chung has extended his applied research interests into construction sustainability and durability of infrastructures. His interests include corrosion protection and galvanization, atmospheric corrosivity to exposed structural steelwork as well as sustainable steel construction in close collaboration with the iron and steel industry in China. Prof. Chung is dedicated to contribute proactively to the socio-economic development of Hong Kong, in particular, to the construction industry in facilitating the development of Hong Kong into a world class Centre for International Engineering Design of Infrastructures. \n6.1 Recent Research Projects\nWith the support of the construction industry, Prof. Chung had successfully secured the following two research projects on corrosion and corrosion protection of structural steelwork using hot-dip galvanization:\nMay 2010 to\nApr 2012\nEnhanced ductility and service life of galvanized structural steel members\nResearch funded by the Innovation and Technology Programme of the Innovation and Technology Funds under the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Government of Hong Kong SAR at HK$4,977,000 administrated by the Nano and Advanced Materials Institute.\nMay 2012 to\nOct 2013\nEnhanced durability and mechanical performance of structural steel members using an innovative galvanization process\nResearch funded by the University and Industry Collaboration Programme of the Innovative Technology Funds under the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Government of Hong Kong SAR at HK$2,416,300.\nProject Objectives:\n(1) To develop an innovative galvanization process to produce zinc-aluminum galvanization coatings with enhanced ductility and mechanical performance. While the Galfan technique is well established for galvanization of steel wires, cables and sheets through a ‘continuous galvanization’ process, the application of the technique to structural steel members requires a comprehensive research and development programme to modify the process into a ‘discrete galvanization.’\n(2) To compile a technical guidance on specification, inspection and quality assurance for the local construction industry in Hong Kong. It should be noted that the technical guidance will be provided to government departments and regulatory authorities to encourage direct adoption of the proposed method in construction projects. \n6.2 Future Research Plan\nSustainable Steel Construction\nAs President of the Hong Kong Constructional Metal Structures Association, Professor K F Chung has established professional collaboration with the following industrial associations in the Region since the establishment of the Association in July 2010:\nThe Singapore Structural Steel Society\nThe China Iron and Steel Association\nThe China Constructional Metal Structures Association\nThe China Steel Construction Society\nThe International Zinc Association\nThe Taiwan Institute of Steel Construction\nIn order to encourage sustainable steel construction in the Region, high performance constructional steel materials with excellent properties in strength, toughness, and resistances to fire and corrosion should be developed. Moreover, complementary technical guidance on design, construction, testing and quality control on the use of these high performance materials should also be developed under a joint collaborative effort in the Region through the international network of the Association:\n1 To develop high performance constructional steel in building structures\nHigh strength steel materials with good ductility.\nHigh corrosion and fire resistant strip steel materials\nStructural behavior of high strength steel members\n2 To promote the use of high performance steel materials in construction projects\nTo promote effective use of high performance steel materials in construction projects which are designed to BS 5950 and Eurocodes 3 and 4 with Eurocodes materials specifications.\nTo promote full adoption of Chinese steel materials among design and construction engineers, architects, as well as regulatory agents and other construction professionals in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Malaysia as well as countries in Asia and the Middle East.\n3 To disseminate knowledge on the use of international codes of practice\nTo introduce Eurocodes to designers, fabricators and material suppliers in Hong Kong, Macau, and major cities in China through seminars and training courses.\nTo compile a comprehensive set of self-learning materials on Eurocodes for practicing engineers.\nTo provide a Chinese version of the Steel Designers’ Manual 7th Edition which was recently updated in compliance with Eurocodes. \nIt is reckoned that wide adoption of high performance constructional steel S460, S690 and S960 will improve the constructability of infrastructures by 100 to 200%. This will provide huge savings in steel materials as well as labour costs (for fabrication and erection), transportation costs and many other associated costs. The construction professionals in Hong Kong should take advantage of the latest development in sustainable steel construction and position Hong Kong into a world class Centre for International Engineering Design of Infrastructures, through the effective use of high performance constructional steel in compliance with Eurocodes. \nAdditionally, it should be noted that China is currently the largest steel manufacturer in the world, producing over 40 to 55% of the world steel tonnages in the last five years. The development of a new market of high performance constructional steel in building structures in the Region will definitely have positive impacts to both the iron and steel industry and the steel construction industry in China. With the new markets for Chinese steel materials, steel manufacturers in China will be able to upgrade their production towards technologically advanced methods, which will also be environmental friendly. This should be taken as an important step for China to develop towards sustainable steel construction in the coming decades.",

  "text": "Since the sixties of the past century, the University of Western Ontario (UWO), Canada, has been a main source of knowledge and innovation in the field of Wind Engineering. This has been pioneered by Professor Alan Davenport who passed away on July 19, 2009, leaving a wealth of knowledge that has influenced the design codes globally. In this presentation, the Davenport’s wind loading chain will be presented together with the history of the establishment of the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory (BLWTL) at UWO. Since 1964, more than 2000 landmark projects have been carried out at the BLWTL through testing wind sensitive structures, such as skyscrapers, towers, and long span bridges. The presentation will highlight some of those projects and their unique features. While Davenport’s wind chain was based on a thorough probabilistic approach, it involved linearization assumptions for both the wind field and the structural response, which allowed to carry on solutions in the frequency domain. Also, wind tunnel tests focused on either small-scale rigid model or aeroelastic models to determine structural and cladding loads and/or to investigate various aeroelastic instability phenomena for slender structures. With the advancement of computational tools and the establishment of large-scale wind testing facilities, the research at UWO has extended to a new horizon. Some of the recent development will be presented including a ductility based nonlinear approach for the wind design of tall buildings, full-scale testing up to failure of low-rise buildings under simulated wind loads, nonlinear section testing of super long-span bridges, the use of tuned-liquid dampers to control the wind vibration of tall buildings, and research on double curvature long-span cable domes. Localized wind events, often referred to High Intensity Wind (HIW) events, include downbursts, which are associated with thunderstorms, and tornadoes. The first three-dimensional wind testing facility, the WindEEE dome, that can provide large-scale simulation of this type of wind was established at UWO in 2012. The presentation will highlight the capabilities of WindEEE and will present the outcomes of the research conducted on two types of HIW-sensitive structures, transmission lines and wind turbines. This research resulted in the establishment of the first specifications in the world that account for the effect of downbursts and tornadoes on transmission line structures, which was recently incorporated into the American Society of Civil Engineering guidelines.",

  "text": "CEE Researchers Discovered Smog-aggravating Chemical in Hong Kong’s Air\nIn a field study at coastal site in Hong Kong, a team of CEE researchers discovered unprecedented concentrations of molecular chlorine (Cl2) during autumn when ozone pollution reaches its annual peak. In collaboration of international scientists, the study team found that the high Cl2 is produced by interaction of man-made pollutants (NOx and acidic chemicals) with natural sea-spay particles. This pollution pathway is important not only for Hong Kong but also other coastal cities. The findings can help to adjust or refine measures to reduce ozone pollution.\nThe study results were published on 17 Feb 2022 in Nature Communications. The first author is Dr Xiang Peng who was a PhD student at the time of this study, and the corresponding author is Prof. Tao Wang of CEE. Other contributing authors included Prof. Hai Guo, Prof. Shun-cheng Lee, and additional PhD students and researchers from CEE, personnel from Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department, and scientists from the US, France, Spain, Sweden, Germany and mainland China.

  "text": "余嶺\n博士研究生, 2006\n黃埔二三事\n初識香港與香港理工大學（HK & PolyU）\n香港是國際大都會、全球金融中心和中西方文化交融之地。初次與香港及香港理工大學的邂逅，還是在1995年的12月份，當時應邀參加中國振動工程學會、南京航空航太大學與PolyU主辦的SDVNC’95國際會議。有幸與德國的Prof. M Link、Dr. S S Law、正在PolyU讀博的師弟S等國內外學者在一個session交流彙報。在與他們的交流中發現我們有共同的研究興趣與領域。後來，又從師弟S那裡得知，我碩士同學C也在PolyU讀博士，不過不在CSE，而是在機械系。大會的最後一天是學術參觀，正好遇到了C，我們聊過去、現在以及他在香港的學習、工作與生活。昔日的師弟與同窗都這麼努力、進取與拼搏，我如果也能找到機會來PolyU學習和深造，那該有多好啊！ \nPolyU的全英文學習氛圍拓寬了我的國際化視野、提升了我的學術境界和高度\n勇於嘗試，夢想終會照進現實。1997年4月，我終於成功登陸香港，來到夢寐以求的PolyU。先是在Dr. S S Law的課題組做Research Assistant。通過近半年的努力，英語和程式設計計算方面算是適用了PolyU的快節奏和高強度，但成果很是一般，既沒有很好達到Law的要求，也沒有達到自己的期望值。究其原因，還是自己的基礎知識與學術積累不夠！正當一年RA合同期所剩無幾的時候，德國的Link來信問我後期有何打算？Law也關心問我未來是否還想讀PhD？在Law的推薦和幫助下，我又成功申請到在PolyU的讀博機會，導師是Dr. Tommy H T Chan和Dr. S S Law。正當我著手辦理到PolyU讀博的手續時，Link又幫我成功申請到德國DAAD資助經費，是三個月的短期訪學機會。到底是去德國還是去香港？我當時的想法是希望1998年5-8月先去德國短期訪學，然後9月再返回PolyU繼續讀博。經過多方努力和溝通協調，最終實現了這一願望。現在想想，真的十分感謝我內地原工作單位的領導和同事為我所做的一切。\n在PolyU讀博期間，給我印象最深的有兩件事情。一是PolyU當年並沒有給博士生安排課程學習，但卻邀請了許多國際知名教授來校做短期學術講座，且聽完43個學時的講座就可以折算為一門課程的學分；二是每年提供一次出國參加國際學術會議的經費。當時CSE邀請的國際知名教授有很多，與我研究方向相關的有：美國的Prof. L A Bergman、Prof. A Nowak、 Prof. C Tan以及加拿大的Prof. A Mufti等等。當時Mufti和他助手Bakht聯手在CSE講解結構健康監測（SHM）時，還能在報告現場即時連結加拿大當地的SHM系統，可以線上操控和查看現場SHM實況。這在現在不算什麼，但在當年卻把大家都震撼到了，原來SHM還可以這樣來做！實際上，博士生們不僅是PolyU各種講座的受益者，也是講座的參與者。回想在PolyU期間，我也有幸參與到Mufti、Nowak及Tan等教授的講座接待工作。記得1999年，我到機場去接Nowak時，他的托運行李沒能同機到達，隨身攜帶的僅有講座材料及幻燈片等重要資料，其他衣物等都在托運行李之中！後續三天的講座，沒有替換衣物，這可如何是好？所幸的是我與他身高體型相當，我的襯衣等衣物可以先借給他用，算是解決了他的燃眉之急。後來每次在國際學術交流活動中再次遇到Nowak時，他總要向周圍的同行說起這件事情，並一再向我表示感謝。另外，還有一事，也是我想在此特別要致謝的。Tan也是我導師Tommy的好朋友，每年回香港都被邀請來PolyU講學，我每次都十分珍惜這樣的學習機會並從中大受裨益。2001年9月我去美國匹斯堡參加ASME DETC’01國際學術會議，不幸遇到“9.11恐怖襲擊事件”。9月12日是大會最後一日，與會者陸續發現自己的航班已被迫取消，無法按原計劃返航或繼續後續行程，我也不例外。正當我一籌莫展時，Tan主動過來問我如何返程？他是從底特律開車過來參會的，若需要，他可以把我順路帶到底特律！真是老天自有安排，我師兄就在底特律。在師兄那裡住了一周，這才等到航班複航，順利回到香港。要是當時沒有Tan的幫助，還真不知道如何是好？回想起來，真的十分感謝Tan的真誠幫助。除了邀請海外專家學者，PolyU還注重邀請內地專家學者來港交流。我後來也有幸參與過接待PolyU“傑出中國訪問學人”活動，包括張光鬥院士、劉人懷院士等。他們的到訪給香港帶來了三峽工程等內地重大工程及其研究最新進展等重要資訊，為香港瞭解國家發展與重大技術需求提供了重要視窗，不僅加強了兩地學人的相互交流，更促進了兩地學術聯繫與發展。\nPolyU一流導師團隊指導我夯實學術研究基礎、練就獨立從事科研的能力\n97回歸前，CSE引進了一批年輕教授，他們從海外名校博士畢業後來PolyU工作，正是大展拳腳的階段，我有幸在此期間與他們同行，在他們的指導下學習與工作，前後歷經近十年。每天基本上都是早八點離開黃埔街的出租屋，午夜時分再返回睡覺，每天在PolyU校園都接近16小時。時間看似很長，但是大家都總覺得時間不夠，因為有太多的文獻要閱讀、思路要理順、問題要凝練。感謝我的第一位學術導師Prof. S S Law，是他把我帶到了學術的殿堂，感受到學術與科研之美，在遇到困難與挫折時，正是他的鼓勵和認可讓我對學術研究有了“繼續堅持下去”的勇氣，屢戰屢敗、愈戰愈勇！也感謝我的博士導師Prof. Tommy Chan給我提供了一個寬鬆的學習環境，培養了我獨立從事科研的能力，如何從前人工作中發現問題、梳理問題和凝練關鍵科學問題，並探尋解決問題的最優解決方案。感謝當時的CSE系主任、院長和副校長Prof. J M Ko為我們所做的一切，他告訴我們如何在保持旺盛學術生命力的同時，如何規劃未來並連結世界，如何“由弱變強”並影響世界。感謝Prof. J G Teng教會了我們如何保持良好心態、靜心研究並享受學術過程，及時悟出“如果沒有長期的學術積累就難以做出高品質創新成果”的道理。感謝Prof. Y L Xu讓我認識到結構動力學的重要性，指導我們掌握 “結構系統”是如何映射和表達“輸入”、“輸出”之間的線性或非線性關係。感謝Prof. J H Yin教會我們如何理解“萬丈高爐平地起”的深刻內涵。還要感謝Prof. Y Q Ni、Y Xia、S Y Zhu等等，在我們返回內地後，仍一無既往地為我們提供學術支援與幫助。\n在PolyU，每天工作繁忙且高效。多人的工作室，雖然滿員但卻沒有內地辦公室的喧鬧，工作時間內也很少有人在室內打電話或高談闊論。聽得最多的就是劈裡啪啦的鍵盤敲擊聲。這聲音對進展順利的人來講，猶如“高山流水”，意味著在程式設計、寫文章、出成果……；但對進展不順的人來講，這聲音意味著壓力的持續增加和放大！每天最開心的時候就是在“大家樂”或“美心”餐廳的午飯和晚飯時間，大家結伴同行，或低聲聊天，或交流討論。這個時候也是學術思想碰撞和大腦風暴的時候，我在PolyU多篇文章的想法，也是在這個時候受到啟發並最終得以實現。在PolyU，有那麼多高手雲集的同學同事，真好！\n壓力不僅僅來自于PolyU導師和專案，還來自于自身和周圍的同學同事。特別是當他們又有文章被頂刊錄用的時候，既是向他恭賀的時刻，也是自找差距的恰當時候。PolyU提供的學術環境，既可以與國際知名教授當面交流與請教，也可以與同事進行切磋和研討。每天近16小時的PolyU日常，表面看似枯燥無味，但各位同事內心卻是心潮澎湃、激情四射，細心和小心的求證也是一個學術歷練過程。因此，每位經歷過PolyU這個大熔爐的淬火歷練，日後無論到世界任何地方，內心都無比強大，學術研究都異彩紛呈，我想與這一段PolyU內心修煉和心智磨礪都不無關係。\nPolyU不僅僅培養了一批又一批高素質人才，同時也成就了不少年輕的PolyU教授。記得每年聖誕新年前的CSE師生聚餐，費用都來自於各位升職年輕教授的私人捐款。其中，多位甚至連續幾年獲得升職。人多的時候，有的小組都有幾十號人。有這些同時來自于內地清華、浙大、同濟、華科、東大等一流高校以及海外知名高校的青年才俊助力，CSE導師不出那麼多高品質成果，那才怪呢？因此，當年這才有“CSE連續十年發表高水準論文蟬聯世界第一”及之後的“論文他引連續十年世界第一”的傳奇佳話！想想自己也是其中的一員，心裡也是美滋滋的。當然，這主要還是得益于CSE一流導師團隊的事必躬親與悉心指導。\n每位同學同事離開PolyU時，都是那麼“碩果累累”。這不僅體現在他們在PolyU期間有不少文章發表在SCI Top期刊上，還表現在PolyU有良好的硬軟體資源和完備的文獻資源。香港回歸前，大家拿的是英國簽證來港學習和工作，到期時還有出國“家電”指標，返程基本帶這些東西。回歸後，大家返程時就完全被另一種東西所取代，這就是有價值的“複印資料”。我記不清楚有多少次為即將到期的校友送行，都要先到深圳幫忙郵寄這些資料，沉沉的幾大箱，每次都累得滿頭大汗，但樂此不疲。內地當時還沒有香港這麼完備的專業英文期刊和著作，PolyU幾乎可以找到能檢索到的全部英文資料，實在沒有的話，也可以通過“館際互借”方式借閱複印。提出申請一兩周後，就基本可以收到世界各地的這些複印資料。CSE每個月給大家的複印配額，在平時還基本滿足需求，但等到要離開時，配額根本就不夠用！記得有一次，內地一位知名教授Q在黃埔街的複印小店與店家發生了爭吵，差點“大打出手”，原因就是店家不讓他一次性複印整本書。這在內地，當年是完全沒有問題的，但在香港，這會帶來知識產權的問題，店家的堅持也是守法的表現。放在現在，相信大家不會再這麼幹，因為內地高校現在基本實現了資料庫全覆蓋，查找全英文的期刊和著作已不是當年“比登天還難”的境地了。每每想到這些，無不讚歎鄧小平“發展才是硬道理”思想的光輝。",

  "text": "Chris KW Cheung\nAssociateship in Civil & Structural Engineering, 1987\nTime flies, it has been 35 years since I left the beautiful campus at the centre of the city. Looking back, it was just like yesterday. During my 35 years in construction industry, like many fellow alumni, I love my works and maintain passion to strike for excellence.\nI am now working in a major reclamation project in Hong Kong. The project adopts sustainable non-dredged method and a new ground treatment method – deep cement mixing. This method treats the in-situ soft clay to provide a strong foundation for the seawall and for the control of reclamation settlement. The new method shortens the time for reclamation and reduce the demand of fill material. The success of the new method proved that reclamation can be done much faster and in a sustainable way.\nI also have chance to collaborate with Prof. J H Yin and his research team on the field trial of an innovative idea of ground treatment works. I was not just amazed by the innovative idea of Prof. Yin but also the passions of his team of energetic research students. The idea of reusing dredged marine mud for reclamation and treated by horizontal drains and vacuum to accelerate the consolidation process, effectively reuse the dredged mud in a sustainable way. The research team also installed innovative instruments for monitoring of the consolidation process by measuring the change in pore water pressure and undrained shear strength in the mud layer. Working with PolyU research team reminded me again that engineering innovation needs passion and patience.\nI would like to share a quote that I remind myself when I face difficult times; “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it – Steve Jobs”",

  "text": "Theo Y.C. Lam \nBSc (Hons) in Environment and Sustainable Development, 2016\nMPhil in Environmental Engineering, 2019\nMy seven-year journal in CEE has been a fantastic one; I found my true calling in being a researcher. Most students who got into this program almost certainly consider sustainability to be one of the core elements in their value system; turning a belief into action requires not only dedication but experience and opportunity. In my undergraduate years, I had a vast experience in various aspects of the concept of “sustainability”, as the program offered courses in fundamental science, engineering, statistics, economics, ecology, environmental law and policy. Such variety empowers the student (a.k.a. me) to make a well-informed decision about their future career. For me, my final year project experience finally lured me into the path of academia.\nCEE is also extremely resourceful. Our department hosts a state-of-the-art third-generation sequencing PacBio Sequel, the first installation in the Pacific-Asia area, and a private cluster of high-performance-computer! Fortunate enough, I was also the first person in charge of this sequencer and received official training in molecular biology and bioinformatics during my MPhil years. I was conducting a global survey of the microbiome in anaerobic wastewater, and this sequencer helped me get my first paper published. In addition, the bioinformatics skill I acquired from the training earned me a position in developing a bioinformatics pipeline for our fellow researchers at the department of applied biology and chemical technology.\nWith strong international connections, CEE allowed me to visit places like the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and TU Delft. And now, I continue to pursue my PhD at Imperial College London, which has a strong affiliation with CEE.\nI am grateful for the opportunities arisen and the people I met during my years in CEE, I could not imagine what my life would be otherwise.",

  "text": "Kiki Sze Ki Hui\nBSc (Hons) Environment and Sustainable Development, 2016\nStudying for ESD at CEE has been a precious and fantastic journey for me. This programme offers courses on a range of subjects from science, engineering, environmental policy, law, theoretical calculation, hands-on design, air and noise control, to the management of solid waste, wastewater and water. Such wide coverage on various environment-related topics has allowed me to discover where my passion lies. I chose a topic related to wastewater for my final year project, which eventually led me to my current career.\nI graduated from the ESD programme in 2016, and am currently working in REC Engineering Company Limited as Senior Engineer. My knowledge in wastewater process and fluid dynamics has brought me opportunities to help my company bid for sewage treatment plant projects and gave me the opportunities to get involved in sewage treatment plant design. When I coordinate with various parties, such as the government departments, architects, consultants, contractors and suppliers, I can easily understand their points of view by integrating what I learnt during my four-year university study. I am glad to be able to be involved in both sewage pumping station and sewage treatment work projects, and find it especially challenging to work on two membrane bioreactor (MBR) sewage treatment plants. To become a more all-round engineer, I continuously develop my knowledge and skills from processing, mechanical, electrical and project management perspectives.\nLast but not least, I had an amazing and unforgettable time with my classmates in ESD. We worked, played and laughed. Today, we still keep in touch after graduation to share updated information in our industry.\nMy four-year study in CEE and ESD had built me a solid career foundation and brought me the opportunities of entering environmental engineering industry. I am glad that I have spent my university life with the great people I met here.",

  "text": "Tiger Wong\nBSc (Hons) in Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health, 2008\nIt is my pleasure and honour to share my story in this corner. Graduated from EOSH in 2008, I still remember my happy university life, especially the days with my classmates and friends.\nGammon Life- Site Safety Professionals Award\nAfter finishing my years of study in the “Red-brick Castle”, I began my career in 2008 as Health and Safety Trainee at Gammon Construction Limited (“Gammon”), where I participated in serval projects, including building and civil projects. Now working as a Safety Manager, I am mainly responsible for handling project-related safety management issues, protecting workers’ lives, and fostering a culture of safety within the company.\nGammon plays a leading role in improving construction safety across the industry. In 2011, with nomination by Gammon, I was granted the Site Safety Professionals Award by the Construction Industry Council and the Lighthouse Club. This awards recognises outstanding performance in health and safety.\nJardine Ambassador\nFurthermore, Gammon has provided valuable opportunities and comprehensive training for staff members to explore their interests and widen their horizon in various aspects of the industry. I had been a Jardine Ambassador for 2013-2015, joining other young and enthusiastic executives from all parts of Jardine Group in Hong Kong to volunteer in and drive the Group’s charitable activities in my personal time. Through my involvement in those public activities (such as the Central Rat Race and Walk up Jardine House), I have been able to enhance my organisational skill and interact with people from different occupations to advance my personal development.\nVice-President of Society of Registered Safety officers (SRSO) \nI joined the Society of Registered Safety officers (SRSO) in 2011 and now I am the Vice-President of SRSO 2022-2024. The SRSO was established in 1991 by a group of safety professionals and officers from the Labour Department who wished to gather all Registered Safety Officers (RSO) to further enhance their professional status, and to promote safety and health across industries. I have helped SRSO organise various activities, such as safety seminars, safety trips, annual general meetings and dinners, to promote multi-discipline occupational safety and health, and environmental matters.\nConstruction Industry Council (CIC)\nSince 2017, I have worked in Construction Industry Council (CIC) as Manager in Construction Safety and Manager in Safety Training. My main duties are to strengthen the sustainability of the construction industry in Hong Kong by providing a communication platform, strive for continuous improvement, and increase awareness on health and safety. CIC granted me many opportunities to get exposed to and serve the industry, including meeting different key stakeholders and providing secretariat support at committee, task force and working group meetings. These have improved my multi-perspective thinking, broadened my horizon and deepened my experience in construction safety.\nOutstanding CEE Alumni Award\nIn 2021, I was very pleased and honoured to be granted the Young CEE Alumni Award 2020, which is jointly established by CEE and the Civil and Environmental Engineering Alumni Association (CEEAA). I am truly thankful to CEE and CEEAA for this prestigious recognition.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank CEE and all of my “C-Fu and Masters” for equipping me with professional knowledge and skills for my career development! They enabled me to gain valuable experiences that ignited my passion to be a better safety practitioner who can contribute to society.",

  "text": "Nicole Tiantian Chen \nDoctor of Philosophy in Environmental Management and Engineering, 2021\nAssistant Professor, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)\nIn March 2021, I received my PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering from PolyU. The University has been my home since 2017 and this year marks my 6th anniversary here. I will be leaving Hong Kong in a month to pursue my academic career as an Assistant Professor at the Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Mobility at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).\nAfter graduating with my master's degree and working in the industry for more than a year, I began studying for my PhD. It was my passion to do research, and I applied for the PhD programme because I was interested in the research direction of my PhD advisor. I would like to express my most sincere gratitude to my chief supervisor, Dr Nang-ngai Sze, for his unreserved guidance and supervision. The priceless time he spent with me on my research is highly appreciated. My heartfelt thanks also go to my co-supervisor, Prof. Anthony Chen, for always sharing interesting ideas with me, encouraging me to expand my research area, and providing professional advice and support to me. I would also extend my sincere thanks to my fellow road safety and transportation team members for sharing their insights during our discussion. Last but not least, I wish to thank our laboratory technician Emily Fung for her efficient assistance during my experimental works.\nCEE provides students with numerous opportunities to improve their research capability and expand their international research network. Under CEE’s support, I attended various research activities such as international conferences, exchange programmes, and research project competitions in the UK, US, Japan and Australia during my PhD years. Through research presentations, I have learnt how to effectively communicate with my peers and share my ideas. It was during my PhD study when I most frequently initiated international collaborations. We also occasionally invited renowned professors from other universities to conduct seminars or summer courses, in addition to the practical and cutting-edge courses offered by CEE. I must say these experiences played a significant role in my job search for faculty positions.\nAfter completing my PhD, I joined a research team at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) of PolyU as a post-doctoral fellow. I managed time well with high research productivity, while looking for faculty positions and getting invited to a number of interviews. This spring, after three rounds of interviews, I finally received an offer from KAIST—one of the top public universities in South Korea (ranked #41 in QS World University Rankings 2022).\nThere are in fact a lot of excellent researchers at CEE. My humble suggestion for my friends as well as current and future students of CEE is: time spent in “vain” may be worthwhile in the end. All things are difficult before they are easy. If you have the courage to take the first step and stay on your course, good things may come your way.\nMy deepest gratitude goes out to CEE once again. Without the support from the professors, team members and friends from the Department, this journey would not have been possible.",

  "text": "HK$44 Million Secured from RGC Theme-based Research Scheme to Tackle Grand Challenge in Air Pollution and Public Health\nAir pollution is the greatest environmental health risk factor for premature deaths worldwide. Among all air pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the deadliest. Since PM2.5 is a cocktail of components from a mix of sources and not all components or sources are equally toxic, research on the toxic components and their associated sources responsible for PM2.5 health effects plays a key part in air quality management.\nThe project, titled “Unravelling the Black Box between Air Pollution and Public Health for Transformative Air Quality Management”, is co-led by \nProf. Xiang-dong Li, Dean of Faculty of Construction and Environment (FCE), Director of Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development (RISUD), Chair Professor of Environmental Science and Technology; and Prof. Ko Jan Ming, Professor in Sustainable Urban Development. It has been awarded HK$44.5 million worth of funding by the Research Grants Council (RGC) Theme-based Research Scheme (TRS) 2022/23 (Twelfth Round).\nAs the project coordinator, Prof. Li will lead a multi-disciplinary team of 10 researchers from PolyU, CityU, CUHK, HKU and HKUST. The project is expected to generate solid evidence of key PM2.5 toxic components and emission sources that contribute to the acute toxicity of PM2.5, particularly in the exacerbation of two index diseases of the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischemic heart disease (IHD).\nFurthermore, the research team will evaluate the benefits and costs of their proposed strategy of targeting the sources of PM2.5 toxic constituents against the conventional approach targeting total mass concentrations when formulating air quality management policies. Effective, practical, and economical approaches to managing air quality and public health will be recommended. For example, the completion of the current project may lead to 1) a revision of the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) algorithm and the associated “Health Advice”; and 2) a review and update of the Air Quality Objectives (AQO) in Hong Kong. The experience in Hong Kong may also serve as a case model for the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and ultimately for the global community.",

The programme offers students the opportunities to learn comprehensive knowledge and practical skills relevant to ESD. The programme courses cover air and noise pollution control, water and waste management, environmental impact assessment, energy sustainability, and sustainable designs. As students, my classmates and I acquired hands-on experience from laboratory classes in conducting environment-related measurements and experiments. The diverse range of courses allowed me to establish an extensive vision of the ESD industry.\nIn Year 3, I interned at Acoustics and Air Testing Laboratory Co. Ltd. Under the help of my seniors, I was able to set up and operate tools for on-site noise monitoring and air quality testing. In the final part of the internship, I even successfully constructed an acoustic model based on real-life cases. Working as a student intern enabled me to apply the knowledge I gained academically, and most importantly, to acquire practical working experience. \nAfter graduation, I joined the Green Building Team at Fugro Technical Services Ltd. Apart from environmental certification projects under BEAM Plus, LEED and WELL, I had also been involved in various types of on-site measurements concerning air quality, thermal, acoustic, and water quality measurements. Currently working in the Sustainability Team at WSP (Asia) limited, I participate in the sustainable design of large-scaled projects and support the team to prepare green building certifications.\nI am grateful for the precious experience during my four-year study at CEE, as it provided a solid foundation for me to enter the field of Environmental Engineering and develop professionally in the industry.",

Civil engineers design roads and bridges, plan infrastructure that connects communities, and further improve our living standards. Therefore, civil engineers are always in high demand and have a clear career path like the one that I am looking for.Transitioning from high school to university is not easy. The most difficult challenge is time management. There is a lot of information to handle in the first year. My study might become chaotic if I took on too much. Thus, I have asked the seniors and learnt the way they plan their schedules. Now, I am trying to strike a balance between academic work and other activities. Attending university will be the most valuable experience I can earn, and I believe that it will be beneficial to my personal growth.",

I still cannot get over how mind-blowing it was that I earned my PhD degree here. During my six years at CEE, I was intrigued by the hidden biochemical prowess of microorganisms and that sparked my interest in microbial process and technology in natural and engineered systems. Despite the uncertainties, failures and ups-and-downs in both research and life, I was privileged to receive tremendous care from CEE’s academics, inspirational insights from talented peers, and most importantly, many memorable and fruitful experiences. Fortunately, what CEE offered goes beyond the simple transfer of knowledge – but the enthusiasm to learn, the support to grow, the humility for knowledge and the meticulousness that drives the spirit of craftsmanship in me.After graduation, I took the postdoctoral opportunity at University of Hawaii to manage a pilot-scale anaerobic bioreactor (AD) for industrial wastewater treatment to broaden my practical skills. As a researcher in environmental biotechnology, I had the opportunity to work with academics from the university as well as chemists and engineers from a renewable energy company named Pacific Biodiesel. The pilot-scale AD with acclimated anaerobic granules help treat and re-use methanol-contained biodiesel wastewater in situ and generate renewable electricity from biogas in the Hawaiian Islands.During my PhD study, I took advantage of the research attachment programme to National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan and worked with Dr ‪Takashi Narihiro and Dr Masaru K Nobu, both of whom inspired and enlightened me to become an Environmental Microbiology scholar. To further pursue my research career, I went back to AIST and started my postdoctoral study in Japan from 2019. With a JSPS postdoctoral fellowship, I focused on studying microbial metabolism and evolution for the degradation of artificial contaminants in both the environment and engineered systems. With all the research experiences over 10 years, I feel that the more I learn, the less I know.We are all evolving to a new chapter of life, so is CEE.",

When I was young, I stumbled upon a game called Minecraft. I have been obsessed over this game ever since and have constructed a number of structures in it, from small single-family homes to towering monuments and even an entire city. With an interest in how a structure functions and how it is built, I also explored different aspects of architecture and engineering through watching videos on YouTube. Another somewhat unusual reason behind my interest in the subject is that I like to pay heave attention on the realistic dimensions (such as the supposed structural integrity and internal support) of whatever I am building. These are the major factors that motivate me to pursue a Civil Engineering degree.\nIn university, there is a lot more freedom when it comes to classes and assignments, so discipline and time management is absolutely crucial, as compared with secondary school where there is a rigid system of daily homework and constant practice for exams. Besides, the PolyU campus is much larger than that of a secondary school, so I may explore places that I am curious about, such as the Innovation Tower.",

  "text": "Qianchen Sun, Jason\nBEng (Hons) in Civil Engineering, 2017\nI graduated from BEng in Civil Engineering programme at PolyU with outstanding results and went to pursue the Doctorate degree at the University of Cambridge in 2017. Currently, I work as a research associate at the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction. My work involves the development of underground structural sensing network and anomaly detection system.\nAcademically, University of Cambridge is an environment in which people study alongside leaders in each field, and are given the opportunity to develop skills that will help pursue our goals. My office is situated at the west Cambridge site, a newly built research center consisting of Department of Engineering, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. The university encourages interdisciplinary collaboration among people from different fields. For me as a civil engineer, there are plenty of chances to work together with researchers from photonics group on the application fibre optic sensor technology in infrastructure monitoring, computer science group on data driven engineering subject, or even judge business school on the engineering entrepreneurship project. The past four years has taught me not only how to conduct scientific research in a critical attitude, but also how to promote the industrial application of the research outcome. We have established a long-term cooperative relationship with UK leading construction company through the past four years and attract more than £100K research and development funding up to now. I would say the University of Cambridge is definite a valuable platform for PhD student to learn, to collaborate, to build network with leading researchers and to form connection with industrial experts. The journey to pursuing the doctoral degree may seem arduous, but all these experiences will remain with me for the rest of my life.\nCambridge offers more than just an academic education. Life in and around Cambridge is also vibrant. There are a number of societies, festivals, museums, clubs, restaurants, sports, shopping centers, and many more. One of the most unique features here is the college system. The college provide students with accommodation, support and more. I am a member of Darwin College, a versatile and supportive community. Each week, Darwin College holds formal dinner. The college master gives a speech in Latin before the meal, and college students must wear suit and gown to attend the formal hall. This is definitely a very amazing dining experience and it’s always a good chance to meet new people here. There’s always something happening to keep people entertained in the college. At the end of each academic year, May Ball takes place in the colleges. It is the biggest student party each year. People celebrate all night with stunning fireworks display over the cam river followed by a night of entertainment ranging from comedians to classical and jazz music.\nLife in Cambridge are more than what I mentioned above. In this beautiful small city, there are always something new to explore. I enjoy my research in the university and like the people in this city. I will continue working in the University of Cambridge as a postdoc recently and hopefully I will get a chance to go back to Hong Kong and contribute myself to the research in PolyU in a few years’ time.",

In years of my work, I am thrilled that I could be involved in various mega-sized infrastructure projects, which include the Lung Shan Tunnel Construction, Sha Tau Kok Road to Lin Ma Hang Road Viaduct Construction, and the heavy lift of roof at the Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities. With the valuable work experience gained in these projects, I obtained my Registered Safety Officer qualification (HKSAR) and IOSH full membership smoothly.\nPersonal capability and professional network are equally important for career growth. Because of my thirst for a deeper understanding of my industry, I enrolled for postgraduate programmes to learn and apply new fundamental knowledge to the construction projects. I am also planning to get the Registered Safety Auditor qualification (HKSAR) to further enhance my professional competitiveness. I believe my positive attributes were nurtured by the teachers at PolyU and industrial mentors at VSL and Dragages.\nI would like to express my special gratitude to Mr Roger LEE, Mr Fenkins CHOW and Dr Nicole YIU and those who provided me with great care and support.

I must say there are countless blessings and opportunities given to me throughout the years, and I am so grateful for the professors and mentors who have guided me through the different challenges in my study and career; the classmates whom I cannot survive without through the assignments, projects and exams; and the colleagues who are so supportive such that every task which seems to be so overwhelming at the beginning, could be worked out smoothly every time at the end.\nI would never have thought that I would be staying in CEE for so long when I was still an undergraduate, until I started my internship at SITA Waste Services Limited in the WENT Landfill as a Laboratory Assistant. I got a chance to learn about the mechanisms of how the waste and leachate treatment infrastructure work, as well as the laboratory analysis procedures for multiple sample parameters, in the largest operating landfill in Hong Kong. I have developed interest and passions towards laboratory analysis since then, and most importantly I have learnt to be calmer and more cautious, not only in laboratory analysis, but also in communications with colleagues.\nAfter graduation, I immediately joined the research team of Dr. LEE Po-Heng, Henry as a research assistant. I am so thankful for his continuous guidance and support since I was working on my final year project under his supervision. During the two and a half years of work in this research team, I have my horizon greatly widened in the wastewater treatment industry through conducting research with the bench-scale reactors in the laboratory and even the pilot-scale reactors sited in Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works (SCISTW) and Shatin Sewage Treatment Works (STSTW). Running reactors in research is never just science and engineering stuff. After laboratory analysis, I have to present the data and illustrate how these data can help optimize wastewater treatment processes to the big bosses, not only to those in our department, but to the colleagues from the Drainage Services Department (DSD) and Environmental Protection Department (EPD) as well. Those were fruitful experiences. Before every presentation I was expecting bosses with strong criticisms, but at the end the bosses were all very nice and willing to patiently give advice on how to further improve the laboratory analysis and presentation of data, as well as the way to use the research findings in resolving real-world issues.\nDuring my master’s studies in CEE under the programme of MSc in Environmental Management and Engineering, I have the opportunity to investigate the feasibility of using green wall to treat greywater under the supervision of Professor Onyx WAI and continue to work in the Water and Waste Laboratories.\nAfter my master’s studies, I am now working as an Assistant Technical Officer in the Water and Waste Laboratories. I realize that working as a technical officer is completely different from being a student or a research assistant. There are a lot more responsibilities to shoulder, but I perceive them as learning opportunities and challenges to help me grow in my career. Apart from the routine duties of managing the laboratory and operating different laboratory instruments, I got some hands-on experience with the multimedia software, such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro, in the post-production of the personal portraits of the academic staff and the videos of the laboratory sessions in the light of the suspension of the face-to face teaching activities over the last two years. I still remembered my only question raised at the end of the interview for this job was that whether I could be provided with any on-the-job training in the aspect of multimedia and graphic design. Surprisingly I got plenty of opportunities doing on what I like in my work.\nOnce again, I would like to express my deep gratitude to CEE over the last decade, for not only in building my strong foundation in the field of environmental engineering, but offering me unlimited learning opportunities for my growth.",

  "text": "段元鋒 \n段元鋒\n博士畢業生, 2004\n浙江大學建築工程學院教授\n回憶在香港理工大學的時光\n與香港理工大學結緣開始於2000年暑假，我作為浙江大學派往香港理工大學的首批交換生，在香港度過了6周的學習和文化交流時光。每週一至週五在高贊明教授和倪一清教授的課題組進行科研和學習，週六和周日參訪一些諸如廉政公署、房屋署、生產力促進局、香港賽馬會等機構，以及遊覽香港海洋公園、太平山頂、維多利亞港灣、離島等美麗風景，還會到香港理工大學負責老師家裡去做客、與香港理工大學的同學聚餐，從而瞭解香港社會的方方面面。交流期間，被香港理工大學老師們的學術研究所吸引，他們從事的研究都是關於當時世界上最長的橋，最高的建築，最前沿的科技；為香港理工大學一流的科研條件所震撼，較現在20多年前就可以一鍵檢索的文獻資料、世界領先的科研設備、高效完備的技師隊伍；當然，還為在讀研究生的高額獎學金點贊，除了能經濟獨立，還可以留點積蓄寄給父母。6周的實習結束，倪一清教授建議我申請香港理工大學的博士研究生，於是回到浙大後，在浙江大學導師董石麟院士和香港理工大學導師高贊明教授、倪一清教授的支持下，成功申請了香港理工大學博士研究生崗位，于2001年5月第二次來到香港，正式開始了在香港的博士學習和研究生涯。 \n在香港理工大學的學習和研究工作是十分緊張和高效的。導師、研究職員和研究生都非常專注，幾乎把所有時間都用在工作上。有時為了趕進度，日日加班甚至通宵達旦，硬是把“impossible mission”變為“perfect completion”。適應了這種節奏和壓力，便為日後的工作抗壓能力打下了堅實的基礎。所以，香港理工大學的畢業生大多能從容面對各種壓力，並且做出優異成績。母校科研的一大特色是，面向實際工程問題開展應用基礎研究。我的博士論文題目是“採用磁流變阻尼器的斜拉索振動控制研究”。課題的依託工程項目是由香港理工大學的倪一清和高贊明教授、美國的B.F. Spencer教授、湖南大學的陳政清院士共同負責的“洞庭湖大橋風雨振控制”，這是世界上首次將智慧磁流變阻尼技術應用到橋樑結構。在洞庭湖大橋上，我第一次親眼目睹了斜拉索的風雨振，100多米的拉索，振幅可達到1-2米，非常令人震撼！而應用了團隊研發的磁流變阻尼技術後，風雨振被明顯抑制，幾乎看不到拉索振動。我曾在2003年SARS期間在洞庭湖大橋上進行了45天的風雨振觀測和減振控制試驗研究，租一貨櫃車在大橋上日夜等風等雨，非常辛苦，但卻積累了大量的第一手資料，為博士論文的完成奠定了基礎。此次經歷第一次使我深刻的認識到，通過科研，可以讓大橋更安全，讓世界更美好，我們的科研工作是有價值的。這一經歷也深深的影響了我後來的科研工作：選題要面向重大工程問題，成果要回到工程實踐進行檢驗。雖然，學習和工作非常緊張，但是生活中還是不乏樂趣的。晚上工作一段後，有時大夥兒結伴沿著維多利亞港去跑步，跑的大汗淋漓、氣喘吁吁；有時，坐上地鐵到只有一站之隔的“又一城”看個大片，看完後大家有說有笑回宿舍。說起宿舍，那可是一個“五星級的家”。一樓是餐廳，是大家常吃早餐的地方，也是每年一度的“High Table Dinner”舉辦的地方。 二樓是文體娛樂設施，游泳池、舞蹈室、鋼琴室、檯球室、健身房、閱讀室，一應俱全。從三樓到十七樓，每兩層為一個Hall，分別以理工的校訓“開物成務，勵學利民”為首字母的八個本科生Hall，開元、物華、成德、務賢、勵志、學敏、利生、民殷。另外，十九至二十樓為“博彥堂”，是研究生堂，整座建築的“最高層”。頂樓二十一至二十二樓，是為舍監和宿管處高管的住所。每個Hall都有一位舍監和六位元Tutor，負責組織每個堂的文體娛樂活動。六位Tutor分居各堂兩翼中間的單人房間，有獨立衛生間。其他的每個房間住兩位同學，每兩個房間共用一個衛生間。每個房間都有空調，每個衛生間都有熱水，每個堂的中庭都有電視、廚房。宿舍確實給同學們的學習和生活帶來很大便利。我做了博彥堂一年的Tutor和多年的Senior Tutor，輔助舍監、協調各位Tutor，組織了不少活動。最受研究生們歡迎的活動是每月的“hiking（行山）”。Tutor事先選定路線，貼出海報，做好報名，租好大巴，週末上午大家帶上午餐，乘著大巴到達Hiking起點，之後大家沿著行山徑開始行山，中午大家在山上進餐，達到終點後再由大巴接回宿舍。在行山徒中，一路風光旖旎，一路有說有笑，既鍛煉了身體、欣賞了風景、清新了大腦，還認識了好多的朋友，真實受益良多！在港多年，生活、學習、工作，都深刻影響了我。感謝在香港的老師、同學和朋友，感恩在香港度過的青蔥歲月！祝願香港更美好，祝願母校更輝煌！",

  "text": "Isaac Tang\nBEng (Hons) in Structural and Fire Safety Engineering, Year 1\nI am Isaac Tang, a year one student studying Structural and Fire Safety Engineering. I found this programme on the JUPAS website when I was a Secondary 6 student. And when I did more research in relation to this course, I found that fire safety is an important issue of the construction industry in Hong Kong since skyscrapers in Hong Kong require effective fire safety measures. Therefore, I decided to spend the next four years in this major.\nAfter getting into university, I found that university life is quite different from that in secondary school in many aspects. The most obvious is the learning environment. In university, lecturers do not check on your learning progress as often as your secondary teachers would do. Therefore, excellent time management skills are crucial. Also, the assignments require higher credibility in university. Whilst I need some time to adapt to the university life, there are some interesting aspects. For example, field trips are part of some courses, which provide me a good opportunity to put what I have learnt into practice, offering me another channel to further enhance my understanding of my discipline.",

I feel extraordinarily grateful that the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering had nominated me for CEE Entry Scholarship for outstanding HKDSE Student. \nI have developed an interest in fire safety as my uncle is a fireman. When I saw this subject on the PolyU Information Day, I did not plan to devote the coming four years to structural and fire safety. As I made my JUPAS choices, nevertheless, I was struggling to give priority to either my interest or my HKDSE scores. In the end I think the most important is my interest. So I placed Structural and Fire Safety Engineering as my A1 choice.\nLet’s talk about my university life over these two months. I could not adapt very well at the beginning as university and secondary school are different in many ways. In university, there is plenty of free time and no teacher would force you to study – unlike secondary school where timetables are assigned by school and teacher would push you to meet deadlines. Self-discipline is of utmost importance at university. Excellent time managements are important!",

I am one of the awardees of CEE Entry Scholarships for Outstanding HKDSE Students and majoring in Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Development. \nI have chosen Environmental Engineering because of my interest in environmental issues. As a part of the global village, the problem of global warming and other pollution issues are threatening our world. I believe environmental engineering has a role to play in contributing to a better and safer world as well as to a sustainable Hong Kong. Secondly, environmental engineer is a sustainable job with a lot of opportunities in Hong Kong. With the rise in demand for environmental engineering, I believe that there would be many chances for us to hone our professional skills, training us to become experts in the field.\nDespite my interest in the planet Earth, I was hesitant about putting Environmental Engineering as my top priority because I did not study science in secondary school. But I still chose it as one of my Band A programmes because PolyU offers courses on Physics and Chemistry for non-science students. \nTo help me adapt to the university life faster, I have joined a range of societies and met lots of fellow students. The senior students are very helpful and always keen to lend us a helping hand when needed.",

  "text": "翁順\n博士研究生, 2007 – 2011\n第一屆香港理工大學土木及環境工程學系研究學者校友會理事會秘書長\n華中科技大學教授\n離開香港整十年，比起當初理大的師兄師姐們，我總覺得自己還年輕，還想著等師兄師姐們回憶完了，我再清理清理記憶，拿起笨拙的筆。今天會長說讓我寫一篇黃埔街二三事，我才不得不承認自己已經老了，已經被叫了無數次的師姐了。既然是師姐了，那麽就厚著臉皮寫寫吧。\n我一直視同香港是我的第二故鄉。初到香港就在hall的博彥堂住了三年，幾乎感受不到狹小空間的虐待，美美的生活著。就像蕭紅說的，那時我初次離家，經濟獨立，青春年少，無憂無慮，只覺得世界在面前打開，只等我一腳邁進去，便都是嶄新的，也必定是好的。記憶中R姐、L同學、P同學與我結成四人姐妹團，除了學校餐廳的兩餸之外，也經常在黃埔街覓食。路過一個個茶餐廳，櫥窗裡掛著油黃黃的白斬雞，烏亮亮的燒鴨燒鵝，紅彤彤的紅腸旁紮一束翠綠綠的蔥，邊上總有四十來歲的夥計，將金黃色的燒豬燒鴨燒鵝切得“擦擦響”。再走幾步就有燒賣、魚蛋、雞蛋仔的小吃，味道美美的，每一次路過都不會錯過。黃埔街的記憶就是我們開小灶的地方，即使不餓，也禁不住這街道的誘惑。離開香港十年了，我也經常在武漢尋覓那所謂的港式茶餐廳，哪怕老板吹噓的再正宗，我也找不到黃埔街那叉燒飯和燒賣魚蛋的味道。\n大概是上帝打盹去了，享受了三年無憂無慮的生活之後，被從hall裡面“轟出門”，提著行李滿處找住的地方，也正是我正在準備寫博士論文的時候，學業壓力大了，找住房的壓力也大了，在黃埔街走了很多趟。中介大姐帶我看了很多個房子，一間間的天價鴿子籠，在我快要失去信心、中介大姐快要失去耐心的時候，住進了聯成大廈。也許是壓力大了，也許是年紀大了，黃埔街的叉燒和小吃被狹小的空間和亂亂的心情擠壓著，記憶甚少。心情不好的時候，我時常一個人走過黃埔街，去紅磡碼頭看天星小輪，紅磡這邊的海離星光大道很遠，海邊是靜謐的房子，少有遊客的熙攘。萬家燈火在海面投下萬千的光影，那光影碎成無數的星點，美到極致也亂在心頭，暢想著什麽時候能有一盞燈是為我點亮的。寫論文昏昏欲睡的時候，也會約Z妹一起去紅磡碼頭海邊跑步，沿著海一路跑到回廊的盡頭，氣喘籲籲，大汗淋淋，回來的路上在“芝麻綠豆”就著香甜的芝麻小丸子、楊枝甘露閒聊三言兩語，便也將一日裡學業的困擾，離家的孤獨，通通消解下去，只剩下回去鴿子籠憨憨睡一覺。\n香港的日子伴隨著青春的甜美，也有苦澀，經歷了成長和挫折。時常回憶香港那最青春的五年，無憂無慮，沒有牽絆。一眨眼就是十年，如今的我，一家四口，只有忙碌沒有孤獨，經濟富足，也有餘力看更多的風景，卻十分想念香港那段孤獨、拮据和青春的日子。這十年，感謝導師給機會，我也時常再去香港，看到曾經的師長仍然勤勤懇懇的工作，師弟師妹們仍然在奮力拼搏，香港留給我的勤勉努力依然在，依稀也能看到當年的我。\n寫回憶錄的規矩是圖文並茂，那麽好吧，來一張無憂無慮的hiking照，仔細想想應該是粉嶺蝴蝶山那一次。",

It eventually led me to pursue my career in construction safety and environmental management. I started as an Assistant Safety and Environmental Officer in Hanison in 2009 after graduation. Hanison is committed to nurturing newcomers and maintaining a close partnership between staff members. The seniors did not only provide guidance to us patiently, but also led me to take up various challenges, such as coordinating an in-house professional symposium in mainland China and serving as a host in company’s annual dinner for five consecutive years. \nI believe PolyU EOSH and EME are highly sophisticated programmes that can take care of students’ needs in academic studies, and enrichment of professional knowledge , which are important keys for us to start, develop and succeed in our career. The life in PolyU has also enhanced my analytical and critical thinking skills, enabling me to solve different troubles. Having worked in the construction industry for years, I recalled that I could always apply what I have learned to the ever-changing working environment. \nI sincerely wish all CEE students every success in finding and achieving their goals.",

  "text": "Lai Ho Man\nBEng (Hons) in Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Development, Year 1\nIt is very beautiful. It is a historical building. This was my first impression on PolyU. Being officially a student of this university, I am deeply impressed by the learning atmosphere on campus. \nChoosing EESD was actually a fortunate stroke of serendipity. I enjoyed studying Geography in my secondary school years, especially the topics related to the environment. Considering EESD can provide students a chance to get deep insights into different environmental issues, I decided to commit myself to this discipline. \nThe classroom environment in PolyU is great. The lecturers give us well-organized lessons and we raise ask questions frequently. In this semester, we have a chance to go to the Noise and Safety Laboratory and do experiments about occupational safety and health – the experience is just rewarding and amazing!Most of the lectures are conducted in English. Therefore, it is vital to improve my English. For me, I often read newspaper articles to expand my vocabulary and learn more sentence patterns. Listening to TED talks and podcasts are helpful to practice the listening skill. With more exposure to English, I believe I have a firmer grasp of this language, making it easier for me to adapt to the university studies. I am so blessed to have met my English teacher when I was in Secondary 6. From her, I have learned to cherish the learning time, especially when we have a good learning environment. To ask if I am having a good learning time now? Always.",

  "text": "Lim Jewel Xin Wei\nBEng (Hons) in Civil Engineering, Year 2\nAs Malaysian Chinese, I would say that it is easier for us to adapt to the life in Hong Kong compared to other international students as we understand English, Mandarin and Cantonese. In my opinion, apart from attending physical lessons and extra-curricular activities on campus, staying in halls of residence is the easiest way to make new friends. One of my favorite hall events was the Lantern Festival Event in the Hung Hom Halls. That was my first Lantern Festival away from hometown, and was therefore not least meaningful. The organizers prepared various games related to the festival such as lantern-making and paper cutting. Besides the large variety of hall events throughout the semester, I also went café hopping and groceries shopping with my hall mates.\nThe International Students’ Community here is particularly warm and welcoming. As an introvert, I was once worried about not being able to make friends in this University. However, the international students, particularly those staying in halls, were really friendly. We would often share our cutlery and meals. In my second year of studies, I took the initiative to be one of the executive committees of the International Student Association (ISA), hoping to serve the International Students’ Community and to make more friends. We organized a few events such as the Virtual Sign Language Workshop, Global New Year Gala 2021, Career Development Workshop and the ISA Online Orientation Event, which were all well-received.\nRegarding my studies at PolyU, Industrial Centre (IC) training was one of my favorite subjects. This is because we are given the opportunities of practical trainings. For example, I have learned to mix mortars, align bricks and saw tiles through the bricklaying and formwork modules. I was also able to put theoretical knowledge into practical engineering problems. In addition, as the tasks in IC training usually required us to work in groups, we also learned the importance of teamwork and effective communication.\nDue to the pandemic, we basically had classes online most of the time. After three semesters of virtual learning, I really look forward to meeting my course mates and attending lectures in lecture halls. I believe that my university life would be more fun and interesting upon the resumption of face-to-face lessons!",

  "text": "Vincent Tjuatja\nBEng (Hons) in Civil Engineering, Year 3\nStudying in PolyU has been an unforgettable experience for me. As an international student, I initially had mixed expectations. I was daunted by the thought of wider cultural exposure and a different living environment, but at the same time intrigued by the idea of pursuing education in the subject that I am passionate about. Still, studying in PolyU has never failed to surprise me. \nWhile I anticipated a wider cultural exposure, I never expected to experience cultural over-exposure. Cultural shock was such a major problem for me. Staying in a foreign place, with no knowledge of the local language, there were countless times that I felt homesick. Lucky for me, I met some classmates from Hong Kong, India, Kazakhstan, and Korea who are very kind and friendly. Through our conversations, I realized that I was not the only one going through the cultural shock and they are there for me if I need any help.\nStudying civil engineering at PolyU was also quite different from my expectation. Before I came, I used to think that civil engineering is a heavy calculation-based subject and expected to spend most of my time studying in a classroom. However, it turned out to be a different experience. The programme covers both theoretical and practical areas, ranging from classroom-based studies to practical training such as laboratory sessions, industrial training, and site visits. I am grateful that CEE places equal emphasis on both study modes which are essential for us to acquire technical knowledge and practical experience. \nOverall, I believe that studying civil engineering in PolyU CEE has been a life-changing experience. While I initially expected to improve academically, it turns out that I have grown personally as well. It is not only about learning civil engineering concepts, but also meeting new friends, developing engineering sense, and exploring new opportunities.",

Over the past two years at PolyU, I have been involved in many projects, and gained fruitful research and internship experience.\nI am currently working on the research project under the supervision of Prof. Chi Sun Poon. Students who are interested in doing research can join the PolyU Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scheme (URIS), where students have a chance to get support and funding for their research area. Our research area is sustainable construction materials, and we are investigating the influence of using carbonation treatment on the properties of recycled aggregate with the aim to increase the re-usability of construction waste. Besides conducting experiments, I have the opportunity to meet with specialists and discuss the commercial aspects of the research: possible demand and applications of the research outcome in the industry. \nPolyU puts emphasis on the integration of knowledge and real-life applications. For this, there is a special program called “Inspire Mentorship”, where students can be under the mentorship of professionals of their fields of interest. In my case, I am a mentee of Mr Stephen Au, the managing director of MTECH Engineering Co., Ltd. He guided us on new projects and shared with us the trends, technologies, news and other insights in the construction industry. All these help me prepare my professional career in the construction field. \nWith my exposure and knowledge acquired from PolyU, I was successfully hired as a façade engineering intern in one of the leading consulting companies in the construction industry - Arup Group. I am glad that I am becoming more competitive and experienced in civil engineering.",

  "text": "Ir Dr Goman WM Ho\nDiploma in Structural Engineering, 1984 \nPhD, 1992 \nI have been a PolyU alumnus since 1984. After my further study in the UK, I joined PolyU again for a PhD degree and started working in a global engineering consultancy, Arup, in 1992. Over the past three decades, I have been working on a wide array of challenging and innovative projects, including the 2008 Beijing Olympics National Stadium, CCTV headquarters and Beijing Capital International Airport Terminal 3. \nI am very grateful that I was involved in the construction of some of the world’s most ambitious tall structures with an accumulated height of more than 9km, including the 297m tall Cheung Kong Centre in Hong Kong, the 528m tall CITIC Tower in Beijing and the 460m tall Vincom Landmark 81 in Ho Chi Minh City. The projects I worked on such as Cheung Kong Center, Beijing National Stadium, Beijing China World Tower, CCTV HQs, ZCB Bamboo Pavilion, Tujiapu Railway Station, CQ Raffle City are all award-winning projects for structure, sustainability and innovation.\nToday, as an Arup Fellow and Director of Innovation, one of my major responsibilities is to push back the boundaries of design and engineering with novel solutions. Besides being the project director for the tallest buildings in Beijing, Tianjin and Ho Chi Ming City etc., I am particularly proud to have contributed to the MiC Display Centre, Hong Kong’s first multi-storey MiC project. Currently, I serve as a technical director for several MiC projects across East Asia, and I am glad to see this construction technology being used in a growing number of projects.\nThe service as an Adjunct Professor in PolyU and HKU, and as a committee member of Civil and Environmental Engineering Alumni Association (CEEAA) enable me to stay connected with the young generation and future engineers. Research and sharing – through books, technical papers and seminars – keep inspiring me for new ideas and better solutions. In the rapidly changing world with ever-advancing technologies, I still believe that engineering is an art -- an art of constant exploration. We should keep asking ourselves : “how can I do it better next time?” Only in this way can we advance to the next level.",

  "text": "Sustainable Marine Infrastructure Enabled by the Innovative Use of Seawater Sea-Sand Concrete and Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites (Contributed by Prof. Tao Yu’s research team)\nA major challenge for marine infrastructure is steel corrosion, which is the main cause for infrastructure deterioration. Typically, steel corrosion costs an economy around 3% of its GDP. Another major challenge for marine infrastructure is the shortage of fresh water and river sand (or crushed stone fines) for making concrete. In 2011, Prof. Jin-Guang Teng, President, proposed to address these challenges by replacing steel with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) (Figure 1a) as the reinforcing material which allows the direct use of seawater and sea-sand in making concrete (i.e. seawater-sea-sand concrete or SSC in short) (Figure 1b). Eventually marine infrastructure will enjoy a longer life span, while energy consumption and environmental pollution will be less in the construction process.\nIn 2018, a project led by Prof. Teng was awarded a grant of more than HK$52.4 million (including matching funding from the local participating universities) to develop new types of reinforced concrete structures made of FRP and SSC (referred to as FRP-SSC structures). The amount of funding is the largest among the five projects awarded in the eighth round of Research Grants Council (RGC) Theme-based Research Scheme 2018/19. In Mar 2020, Prof. Tao Yu, Professor, took over the role of the Project Coordinator from Prof. Teng who assumed his duty as the President of PolyU in Jul 2019 and now serves as the Advisory Project Coordinator of the project.\nThe research project includes the development of innovative steel-free structural forms as well as new methods for the design, construction and performance monitoring of FRP-SSC structures. A key scientific challenge for the team is the establishment of a multi-scale, multi-physics approach for predicting the long-term performance of FRP-SSC structures in a marine environment over a service life of more than 50 or even 100 years.\nStarting from Jan 2019, the project team has made significant progress and some breakthroughs. The project team has proposed design mix proportions for SSC and successfully developed ultra-high-performance seawater sea-sand concrete with a compressive strength higher than 180 MPa. Various innovative forms of FRP-SSC structural members and connections have also been proposed and investigated through experimental and theoretical studies (Figure 2). In addition, the team has developed optical fibre-based humidity and pH sensors for monitoring the moisture content and pH-value inside FRP-SSC structures (Figure 3). To understand the fundamental mechanism of SSC and FRP, molecular dynamics simulations of material structures of SSC and fibre/matrix interfaces have been carried out. Furthermore, accelerated exposure tests and field exposure tests on a large number of FRP, SSC and FRP-SSC structural members have commenced (Figure 4). Partial results of the project have become available through publications in international SCI journals.",

  "text": "Chan Lok Man, Norman\nBSc (Hons) in Environment and Sustainable Development, 2017\nAfter graduation in 2017, I worked as an in-house environmental management trainee under the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) for one year. I was responsible for providing carbon audits and ISO 14001 management service to external vendors, as well as organizing external site visits, workshops, exhibitions and seminars to raise the environmental awareness of employees in UBS. I found the project cooperating with GreenPrice most meaningful, of which food waste minimization is achieved by re-selling the nearly-expired packaged food and beverages at a much lower price.\nAfter obtaining the MSc in Environmental Engineering and Management from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, I joined the Environmental Protection Department of the HKSAR Government as an Environmental Engineer Graduate under the Scheme A training of The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE). I have job rotation every six months and am currently working on the second post. My main duties in the first post were to manage the routine operations and troubleshoot the operational problems in Organic Resources Recovery Centre, Phase 1 (O · Park1). Specifically, I conducted technical reviews to investigate the discrepancy between the designated and actual outcomes and performance along the different modules such as exhaust air treatment system, as well as to evaluate the efficiency in the whole pipeline in O · Park1.\nIn my second post, I worked under the division of wastewater treatment plant design in Organic Resources Recovery Centre, Phase 2 (O · Park2), which is in the stage of design and construction. I have to revise designs submitted by consultants and make mass balance calculations to see if the designated configurations of pipeline, technology adopted, and designated treatment efficiency are reasonable or not. I am also required to conduct continuous on- and off-site environmental monitoring and auditing (EM&A) works in the construction sites.\nI am thankful for the fruitful experience CEE has given me during my study, which has laid a strong foundation for me in environmental engineering and allowed me to make breakthroughs in the industry.",

  "text": "Ir LAU Chun-kit, Ricky\nBEng (Hons) in Civil Engineering, 1989\nRecipient of Outstanding Alumni Award 2020 \nDirector, Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) of HKSAR Government\nI am very pleased and honoured to be bestowed the Outstanding Alumni Award 2020 by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. I am truly thankful to PolyU, my alma mater, and the PolyU CEE Alumni Association, which generously co-sponsors the award, for this prestigious recognition. PolyU has given me much more than the award; it has opened doors for me to meet people that opened even more doors and opportunities, equipped me with what I need to accomplish a multitude of missions, and prepared me for different formidable challenges in my life.\nI still remember my happy university life some 30 years ago. The library had always been one of my favourite places to go. I loved to spend my time there to read, especially during the free time between classes, because I could access books and reference materials of different topics. I wasn’t a total bookworm though, and I started to build up my social network by joining the “Construction and Land Use Students’ Association” and participating in various campus activities such as orientation camp and other extra-curricular events. Through these activities, I met many precious lifelong friends both in and outside of the engineering field. Many of us still gather from time to time, long after our graduation, to recall the fond memories of our campus life, share the experience we gained in workplace, and create new memories together.\nI joined the Government as Graduate Engineer after graduation and since then I had been posted to different departments and bureau, including the Highways Department and the Development Bureaux. I took up the post of the Director of the CEDD in 2018 overseeing the implementation of projects including land formation, new town and infrastructure development, landslide risk management, marine works and coastal protection infrastructures, and greening and sustainability services.\nThe CEDD is committed to striving for excellence in producing engineering solutions for the betterment of Hong Kong. As our work is of high relevance to people’s livelihood, we have been taking a people-centric approach in establishing the planning and design strategies of our projects with consideration given not only to technical and engineering aspects but also social, economic, and environmental factors. I am grateful that my education in PolyU helped nurture me a passion of lifelong learning and an ability to acquire knowledge beyond my profession, which are essential for me to steer projects involving different disciplines and resolving thorny issues behind. PolyU’s teaching always underscores the importance of technological advancements. That’s why I have been leading CEDD to achieve better services and solutions with enhancements brought about by the innovation and technology. This also coheres with the “Construction 2.0” initiative promulgated recently by the Development Bureau.\nThe biggest driving force for me to excel as a civil engineer, which I take great pride in being, is to build and create towards sustainable developments of Hong Kong, and I believe I have been steadily moving towards this goal. I believe that we share the same vision. May you always look back on your university years with great satisfaction and realise that you have seized fully the opportunities given, spent this precious period of your life on learning how to apply academic knowledge in practice, honing both soft and hard skills to prepare for your life and careers, meeting great friends, and most importantly, nurturing the wisdom and courage to embrace the many opportunities and challenges ahead.",

  "text": "A smart system for automatic monitoring and early risk warning of dynamic deflections and possible failures of masonry retaining and large trees\nMasonry retaining walls were built in Hong Kong to provide horizontal platforms and stabilise man-made slopes since 1840s. Trees growing on the masonry walls are identified as stonewall trees. Such unique tree-wall structures have high ecological and cultural values (see Figures 1 and 2). Typhoons have caused widespread damages to Hong Kong including breaking countless trees. In 2018, typhoon Mangkhut, activating the highest tier No. 10 warning signal, caused numerous tree collapse incidents. Refer to DEVB (2018), over 60 800 tree failure reports were received. Among those tree failures, 11 of them were registered as old and valuable trees. To protect the historical trees and unique tree-wall structures, Professor Jian-Hua YIN’s team of the CEE department has developed a self-powered smart system for automatic monitoring and early risk warning of dynamic deflections and possible failures of masonry retaining walls, stonewall trees, and large trees. Dr Dao-Yuan TAN, Dr Wen-Bo CHEN and Mr Pei-Chen WU, as key members of the project team, are actively involved in development of this system. By collaborating with the Works Branch of Development Bureau (DEVB) of HKSARG of China, Three such automatic monitoring systems were installed in three remote sites on Hong Kong Island to monitor the movement of masonry retaining walls and the deflection of stonewall trees using the advanced optical fiber sensing technology.\nOptical fiber sensing technology is gaining lots of appreciation and acceptance in structural health monitoring (SHM), as it is suitable for accurate measurement of strain and long-term monitoring of structures. The first fiber Bragg grating (FBG) was invented by Hill et al. (1978). Since then, FBG sensing technology has become the most widely used optical fiber sensing technology for strain and temperature measurement. Capacity of multiplexing is a prominent merit of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technology, which allows many sensors connected in series for measurement of various parameters. Besides, immunity to electromagnetic interference, high accuracy, and good reliability are its favoured advantages. Therefore, FBG sensing technology is a promising technology for monitoring masonry retaining walls, stonewall trees, and large trees, which may be at risks or subjected to failure when exposed to severe weather such as typhoon or strong wind, heavy rain, increase of ground water or water pressure.\nThe monitoring system is composed of three major components, that is, active sensors installed in the site (see Figure 3), on-site data processing center, and monitoring service to customers. Figure 4 shows a flow chart of the monitoring system. As shown, signals of the transducers installed at a site are detected by the data acquisition system and transferred to the data processing system for data analysis. The dynamic movement of the masonry retaining wall and deflection of the trees are visualized by analysing the real-time data of the transducers. If the deflection of a tree or the deformation of a masonry retaining wall exceeds the pre-set threshold, warning or alarming messages will be sent to the pre-assigned email distribution list. Since no power supply can be provide in the remote areas, a solar power system was utilized as a sustainable solution for power supply to the monitoring system (see Figure 5).\nBeside the current application for protecting the safety of historical trees and the tree-colonized masonry retaining walls, this system has great potential for further other applications in civil and geotechnical engineering, for example, life monitoring of important structures, slopes, debris flows, with smart early warning of possible failure of all these objects based on the deep analysis of dynamic reflections and Artificial Intelligence. \nReferences\nDEVB (2018).
