Zhou\nResearch Assistants:\t\nMr. Po Pei\nMr. T. Wang\nThis research team is in pursuit of innovation of advanced technology in electrical installations and systems in buildings. Current research is focused on power quality & control, electromagnetic environments and protection against lightning.\nThe topics in the area of power quality & control includes modeling of electrical distribution systems, analysis of power quality events (harmonics, surge, etc.) in systems, harmonic mitigation and control using active power filters or others, and reliability of electrical equipment and systems.\nThe topics in the area of electromagnetic environments include identification and modeling of low-frequency, high-frequency and pulse interference sources, characterization of electromagnetic environments, mitigation and control of electromagnetic fields, and electromagnetic shielding.\nThe topics in the area of lightning protection includes characterization of lightning-caused transient currents and fields, model for prediction of probability of lightning striking to a building, effects of bonding and earthing practices on lightning current dispersion, mechanism of building-triggered upward lightning, and development of new lightning detecting/monitoring systems as well as new effective lightning rod/air terminals.\nIt is anticipated that the research in this group will underpin the development of guidelines, tools and products for quality electrical services in buildings. A design guide of magnetic fields for electrical installations has been developed. A software package for evaluating magnetic fields in buildings is currently available. A package of modeling major building structural elements for analyzing lightning-induced electromagnetic environments is being developed. A novel filtering network for controlling harmonics in building distribution systems is being developed as well. An integrated lightning detector capable of recording the electromagnetic and optical radiations from lightning has been developed and is in operation now. A new type of electric field meter with high sensitivity is being also developed. A single-station lightning location system and a new lightning rod/terminal, with which lightning risk to buildings can be effectively reduced, will be designed and tested soon.\nThe research team has a strong relationship with local industry, especially in building services industry. The team has been involved in more than 30 consultancy projects in the past five years.

  "text": "With the rapid increase in population in Asia, especially the development of big cities and citygroups in China, and the increasing number of fire events, fire safety in dense urban areas has to be considered carefully. Big accidental fires had happened before in old high-rise buildings, tunnels, and many vital infrastructures, such as the fire in the World Trade Center induced by the 9-11 terrorist attack, the London Grenfell Tower fire on the façade, and the Tianjin port explosion. Today, the cost of fire on society is estimated at 1-2% of global GDP per year on average, and the cost is likely to be higher for industrialised regions. Fire safety should be examined carefully in new architectural features with deep-plan, high-rise, well-sealed structures, and underground spaces.\nThe overall aim of fire and safety engineering research in PolyU is to develop a scientific understanding of building fires and establish an adequate theoretical basis for fire protection engineering for the world. This includes the physical and chemical processes of material flammability, fire dynamics, heat transfer, fire engineering design, wildland fires, smoke spread patterns, and smart firefighting. With sound basic principles, the total fire safety concept can be implemented by smart fire safety design, advanced building fire protection systems, and new strategies of fire safety management and firefighting.\nResearch Focus\nSmart firefighting. As part of the smart city blueprint, we propose a smart fighting system (SureFire) that can achieve Super real-time forecast (SuRF) for complex building fire evolution. The SureFire System adopts artificial intelligence (AI) and complex data generating networks that enable real-time monitoring of the evolution of urban environments and hazards. Proper analysis of this data based on artificial intelligence can deliver information that continuously determines the state and evolution of systems and diagnoses emergent pathologies, and support decision making. Here, we gathered a multi-disciplinary team with leading local and international researchers and research laboratories, government agencies, and multiple high-tech companies to find answers to the fundamental research questions required to develop the foundational technology for a smart firefighting system that takes advantage of the rapidly evolving technology landscape of cyber-physical systems. Implementation of such a system for smart firefighting will help Hong Kong achieve the status of the world's leading smart city.\nSpecialist Facilities\nThe Department laboratory houses three fire chambers (two 4 m x 3 m x 3 m and one 6 m x 3 m x 3 m) for full-scale burning tests. The chambers are equipped with detection instruments such as thermocouples, velocity sensors, oxygen analysers and gas analysers for measuring the heat release rates and fire environment. Fire protection systems including sprinkler systems, water mist systems, fire detection systems and smoke extraction systems are installed for studying system performance. A cone calorimeter is used for studying the heat release rates of building materials under controlled environment. Standard fire tests on materials, for the ease of ignitability, fire propagation index and the critical oxygen index flammability, etc., can be undertaken. Small wind tunnels for evaluating the thermal sensitivities of sprinkler heads and fire detectors are also available. Oxygen consumption calorimetry was developed with Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. A full-scale burning atrium of size (18 m x 12 m x 27 m) was developed at the State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China.\nCurrent Projects\nSureFire: Smart Urban Resilience and Firefighting\nActive fire protection in supertall buildings funded by the Croucher Foundation\nPyrolysis, ignition and combustion of different combustibles in buildings\nPolymer-flame retardation in silicon/metal halide doped polymers\nThermal decomposition and combustion characteristics of polymeric materials under water mist application\nChemical kinetics of pyrolysis and combustion of combustibles for fire safe buildings\nTheoretical analysis on buoyancy-induced turbulence encountered in building services engineering\nExperimental studies on atrium fires and evaluation of the associated fire services system\nFire safety in train vehicles\nStudies on the operation mode of selected environmentally clean fire extinguishments\nDetermination of the concentrations needed for extinguishing fires with clean agent heptafluoropropane (FM-200)\nFire safety for glass facades in #A23360 and sustainable buildings\nThe skybridge as an evacuation option for tall buildings in Hong Kong\nOnsetting of internal fire whirls in buildings and associated safety provisions\nSmoke emission in burning fire resisting glass with higher rating\nCollaboration with University of Maryland on tunnel fires\nEmergency evacuation in big halls and railway terminals\nFire safety in #A23360 or sustainable buildings\nRisk analysis of escape time from residential buildings in Hong Kong\nFire safety in the residential care homes for the elderly persons in Hong Kong",

  "text": "The Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (BEEE) was officially established in December 1981 (formerly referred to as the Department of Building Services Engineering). We have been serving Hong Kong’s building services engineering industry ever since, promoting sustainable, efficient and healthy indoor and urban living environments in one of the world’s greatest cities by providing world class teaching and conducting internationally leading research. BEEE is one of the constituent departments of the Faculty of Construction and Environment, and offers a full range of taught and research based study programmes leading to awards from Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) to Masters (MSc and MEng) right up to Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).\nAmong many challenges confronting the world, perhaps the most critical is to provide high quality living environments to rapidly urbanising and ageing populations under the creeping threat of a worsening climate and increasing environmental pollution. UN forecasts that the world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050. 70% of the people are projected to live in urban areas, placing enormous strain on cities and the environment. To deal effectively with these challenges, future building engineers will need to be data savvy and work in interdisciplinary teams to deliver optimal solutions enabling smart urban environments incorporating elements such as vertical farms; renewables driven integrated buildings and transport systems; citywide recycling and so on for a sustainable planet and a smart and resilient built environment. In order to promote this vision, we have designed state of the art study programmes providing the best possible training to our students in designing high performance buildings and building systems through judicious exploitation of the sciences and contemporary technologies such as sensor and comms networks, AI and IoT techniques, data science and programming, BIM and digital twin systems etc. This is consistent with our mission, stated as, to imagine, engineer and promote sustainable, salutogenic and safe environments for human habitation.\nBEEE full-time academic and teaching staff members engage in a wide range of research activities organized in the following three research themes:\nBuilding Energy: Energy issues in buildings are addressed in the context of both demand and supply to improve the sustainability of the built environment.\nBuilding Environment: Optimisation of buildings and built environments for thermal comfort, indoor air quality, visual/spatial and vibration/acoustic aspects to improve occupant health and productivity.\nBuilding Safety and Resilience: Protection of building occupants from hazards such as fire and lightning to improve safety and resilience of communities, buildings and built environments.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in our department and programmes and hope you’ll join us in learning to promote smarter urban environments for a better and more sustainable future for humanity and our planet.\nProf. Asif Usmani\nHead of Unit\nDepartment of Building Environment and Energy Engineering",

  "text": "News and Events \nEvent \nSummary\nPeatland wildfires involve flaming vegetation and smouldering peat. The smouldering behaviour strongly depends on peat moisture, which can change significantly and quickly due to weather or human activities. In this study, Dr. Purnomo simulated wildfire in peatlands at the field scale that consider both flaming vegetation and smouldering peat and, for the first time, included daily variations of peat moisture. This presentation will explain the development of the model, the generation of data required for the model, and the discussion of the effect of climate on the severity of peatland wildfires.\nKeynote Speaker\nDr. Dwi Purnomo\nPostdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley \nDr. Dwi Purnomo is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley in the USA.

  "text": "The Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (BEEE) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is proud to announce that two of our PhD students, Mr. Wong Ho Yin and Mr. Cheung Wai Kit, have won the Gold Award for Outstanding Presentation at IFMA's Inter-Institutional Competition on Facility Management Project Presentation 2022-2023. Both PhD students were supervised by BEEE Assistant Professor Dr Huang Xinyan. \nIn February 2023, Mr. Wong and Mr. Cheung presented their latest research ideas and their applications to the fire safety industry, which included their project titled 'Revolutionary Evacuation and Management System'. Their project aligned with FM core competencies in the areas of 'Real estate and property management', 'Technology', and 'Emergency Preparedness and business continuity'. The team's efforts were acknowledged with the Gold Award in the competition. \nThe proposed 'Revolutionary Evacuation and Management System' comprises of two parts: a wireless detectors mesh network and dynamic exit signs. The fire detector system, which utilizes artificial intelligence technology, can significantly reduce the number of false alarms and installation costs. The dynamic exit sign system can guide evacuees towards the safest evacuation paths, reducing evacuation time. This system will be a crucial component of the novel smart firefighting technology developed in PolyU (the SureFire Project). The system can be applied to existing buildings and next-generation smart buildings, further increasing the fire safety level in Hong Kong. \nThe IFMA presentation competition is an inter-institutional presentation competition in the Asia Pacific region that encourages students to pursue Facility Management (FM) as their career of choice. The competition provides a platform for students to exchange ideas with peers from different institutions and receive valuable feedback and comments from professionals in the FM industry. \nThe Department of BEEE congratulates Mr. Wong Ho Yin and Mr. Cheung Wai Kit on their outstanding achievement and wishes them continued success",

Daylighting research concentrates on the study of assessment methods for high-rise buildings in dense urban areas. Methods being studied include those based on an idealized sky condition and those based on realistic climate conditions. A study in applying irradiation mapping technique in the very dense urban environment in Hong Kong is near completion. Currently, the feasibility of applying horizontal light pipes for high rise buildings in Hong Kong is being investigated. An investigation on a comprehensive indicator for daylighting performance in buildings has been initiated. A new daylight glare rating formula has been proposed. A multi-criteria approach for assessing daylighting performance of buildings is currently being investigated. Artificial lighting research deals with the sustainability issues of new family of fluorescent lamps. A review study of the effect of lighting on health has been undertaken with the aim of advising the public on the lighting needs of a healthy building. It is planned to start an investigation into the application of light-emitting diodes for general illumination and to develop internet-based control systems for LED lighting.\nExamples of Funded Projects\nA multi-criteria approach for assessing daylighting performance of buildings (2006-2008 RGC CERG $413,324)\nPerformance indicator of daylighting in buildings (2005-2007 PolyU $170,000/BSE $45,000)\nApplicability of horizontal light pipes for daylighting multistorey buildings in a dense urban environment (2003-2006 RGC CERG $452,812)\nA new schema to quantify solar access and daylight availability for dense urban environment (2002-2005 RGC CERG $433,404)\nSupporting Facilities (and Platforms)\nKonica Minolta T30 Illuminance Measuring System - 18 high quality T30M illuminance sensors measuring simultaneous illuminance with data management software T-A30 Luminance meter LS-100\nSpectrophotocolorimeter measuring system (available in 1st quarter 2006)\nIntegrating spheres (1.5 m diameter and 0.3 m diameter; available in 1st quarter 2006)\nGoniophotometer system (CIE class A; available in 1st quarter 2006)\nLighting simulation software: RADIANCE, ADELINE\nSelected Publications\nH.D.

  "text": "For more info on my research, please be welcomed to visit:\nMy Personal Website\nFor consideration of PhD studies, please also refer to the document detailing my research project: link\nSupervisor Profile\nPhD Project 1\nPhD Project 2\nDr Yuen is an Assistant Professor, Presidential Young Scholar at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in Hong Kong SAR and an Adjunct Lecturer at UNSW. He was a former Lecturer/Centre Manager for the ARC Training Centre for Fire Retardant Materials and Safety Technologies (Centre link: https://www.fire.edu.au). Dr Yuen's research focuses on the development of computational material science modelling techniques to deliver in-depth characterisations of the atomistic physiochemical behaviours of nanocomposites such as interfacial and surface science reactions between molecules. In addition, he also contributes to the fabrication of novel, bio-inspired and multifunctional nano-architectured composite materials. Dr Yuen is currently aiming to synergise his expertise to formulate a systematic, state-of-art fire assessment platform to effectively and physically described the flaming and degradation processes, thermal/electrical conductivities, charring and self-extinction behaviours of advanced materials.\nQualifications and work experiences: Dr Yuen acquired his BEng (Building Services stream) degree at the University of Hong Kong in Aug 2010. He then obtained his PhD degree in Jan 2015 from the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. He specialises in the development of advanced bio-inspired functional materials with experimental characterisations combined with unique computational realisation techniques. \nResearch and outputs: Dr Yuen carries out research on the fundamental polymer degradation and computational materials synthesis modelling of bio-inspired flame retardants and advanced multifunctional nanocomposites. He focuses on developing novel simulation approaches to enhance the reliability and capability of Molecular Dynamics (MD) and computational multiphase fluid dynamics (CMFD) models. I have applied my self-written models and kinetics search algorithm codes on a range of topics across fire safety science topics including characterisation/decomposition kinetics for polymer composites, MD on polymer degradation, infrastructure and wildland fire modelling and in-depth realisation of flame retardant mechanisms. Recently, Dr Yuen aims to synergise my expertise to formulate a systematic, state-of-art numerical modelling platform to effectively and physically describe the thermal degradation, chemical decomposition, thermal/electrical conductivity, charring and self-extinction behaviours of Advanced Materials (i.e. MXene). Dr Yuen has published >110 journal articles, 1 book chapter and >20 conference papers and have >3,000 total citations. As of August 2022, my H-Index is 33 in Google Scholar, 30 in ResearchGate, 28 in Scopus, 27 in Web of Science, which is excellent for an early-career researcher and my research output is continuing to rise exponentially.\nFundings and supervisions: As an early career researcher, Dr Yuen has actively contributed towards AUD $11.96 million in research funding including AUD $11.62 million from external grants (ARC Discoveries, CRC-Ps, CRC Bushfire Tactical Research Fund, Innovation Connections, etc.), since joining UNSW Sydney as in 2015. He has supervised 5 PhD and 5 honours students to completion. I am also the Joint Supervisor of 3 PhD, 2 Masters by Research candidates and the primary supervisor of 2 honours students. All the HDR students are on track for submissions within their expected candidatures and have achieved solid numbers of peer-reviewed publications.\nEditorship and Reviewing experiences: Dr Yuen is currently the Special Issue Guest Editor for the Journal Molecules (IF = 4.927) for the research topic \"New Prospects in Flame-Retardant Materials\", a Guest Editor for the research topic \"Advance in Polymer-Based Flame Retardant Materials\" in the Journal Polymers (IF = 4.967), and a Guest Editor for the research topic \"Flame-Retardant Polymeric Materials and Polymer Composites\" in the Journal Frontier of Materials (IF = 3.515). In terms of international conference membership, Dr Yuen is a local organising committee member of the AOSFST2021 conference (i.e. in association with the Fire Safety Journal). He has extensive reviewing experience (over 100 papers reviewed) in highly received journal articles, which include Applied Energy, Fuel, Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Composites Part B: Engineering, Fuel, MDPI Energies, MDPI Applied Science, MDPI Atmosphere (i.e. ranges from multi-disciplines across fire safety science including computational material science, flame retardants, fire modelling, combustion and soot particle formation models; other topics including computational fluid dynamics, multiphase flows, machine learning algorithms, sound and acoustics). \nTechnology transfer, services to industry and awards: Dr Yuen is a partner investigator for the National Science Foundation US-funded International Network - iFireNet: An international network of networks for prediction and management of wildland fires (link). In collaboration with the Fire Research Unit of Fire & Rescue, New South Wales, Australia, he contributed my expertise in a fire field model to aid the fire investigation of a tragic fire incident in an aged-care facility causing 14 fatalities. For the first time, in Australia, the numerical results were presented as evidence in court to convict the suspect for the arson fire. He was also involved in the development of the Online Fire Safety Training Tool: E-fire Investigation (http//www.efireinvestigation.com.au/) for firefighters to understand the compartment fire development relating to fire loads. In terms of media exposure, Dr Yuen was interviewed by the Guardian for the topic \"Why are Sydney buses still going up in flames and what can be done about it?\"",

  "text": "Congratulations to a team of our undergraduate students, namely Lam Ying Tung and Cheng Tin Yui, for winning the Silver Award of Outstanding Presentation at IFMA’s Inter-Institutional Competition on Facility Management Project Presentation 2021.\nIFMA’s Inter-Institutional Competition on Facility Management Project Presentation 2021\nThe IFMA presentation competition is an inter-institutional presentation competition in the Asia Pacific region. Founded in 2011, the competition encourages students to ignite their passion in the profession and pursuing in Facility Management (FM) as their career of choice. The competition focuses on eleven FM core competencies, including Communication, Finance and business, Human factors, Leadership and strategy, Operations and maintenance, Project management, Quality, Real estate and property management, Technology, Environmental stewardship and sustainability, and Emergency preparedness and business continuity. Eight finalists, coming from different institutions, were shortlisted to the final round of the competition. The project presentation was held on 22 January 2022.\nThe students’ presentation topic falls in the FM core competency “Environmental stewardship and sustainability”.\nPresentation Title:\nPotential Development of Electric Vehicle Batteries Recycling in Hong Kong\nAbstract of Presentation:\nTransportation accounts for around 24% of direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in 2020 (IEA, 2020). The use of electric vehicles (EV) has been a worldwide trend, in replace of traditional vehicles, which offers ideal opportunities for broadening the implementation of renewables to the transport sector. As proved by O’Dea (2019) and Reichmuth (2020), electric vehicles’ life cycle global warming emissions are significantly lower than those for vehicles fueled with gasoline or diesel traditionally, electric vehicles are an option for reducing the exploitation of fossil fuels. However, the lifespan of electric vehicle batteries is estimated to be 3 to 15 years (D. Strickland et al., 2014). Large amount of end-of-life EV batteries is expected to emerge in the near future. It is estimated that the EVs put on the road in 2019 will eventually generate 500,000 metric tons of battery waste to our landfills (Harper et al., 2019). Yet, the recycling industry of EV batteries recycling is still so immature that only a few countries support battery recycling, including Belgium, China, South Korea, the US and the UK. According to the International Energy Agency (2021), the world currently has enough capacity to recycle 180,000 metric tons of dead EV batteries per annum, universal recycling of EV batteries is one of the key issues that researchers have to tackle.\nThe students would like to express their sincere gratitude to Dr. Joseph Lai for nominating them to join the Competition. Also, the students stated that they reflected a lot on these FM topics and got inspired by the judging panel.\nThe Department would like to congratulate Ying Tung and Tin Yui on the excellent achievement.

The conference was held from 24 to 26th February 2022. The theme of the conference was Energy Efficient and Environment-Friendly HVAC&R Systems. It was organised in association with Indian Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ISHRAE) Guwahati Sub-Chapter and it is supported by ISHRAE and American Society of Heating and Refrigeration Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). \nPaper Title: \nInfluence of Water Flow Path on Thermal Comfort of Radiant Ceiling Cooling System - An Experimental Study\nAbstract:\nConstruction and operation in the building sector account for more than 1/5th of global energy consumption. Moving on to an energy-efficient cooling technology and eco-friendly building material can lead to energy saving and reduction in associated CO2 emissions. In the present study, an energy-efficient thermally activated building system (TABS) is integrated with eco-friendly building material, namely, glass fibre reinforced gypsum (GFRG). The proposed hybrid system is termed as thermally activated glass fibre reinforced gypsum (TAGFRG) system. This system is not only energy-efficient and eco-friendly but also provides better thermal comfort. An experimental room is constructed with the TAGFRG roof within the Indian Institute of Technology Madras campus, Chennai, i.e., in a tropical warm and humid climate zone. The TAGFRG roof has reinforcement in every third cavity while the cooling pipes are embedded in the other two with air gap and partial reinforcement. The TAGFRG roof has four parallel loops of cooling pipelines, and each loop consists of one reinforcement zone (RZ) and two air gap zones (AZ1 and AZ2) in series. According to the water flow path in a single loop, various combinations of the flow path, i.e., RZ➔AZ1➔AZ2, AZ1➔RZ➔AZ2 and AZ1➔AZ2➔RZ, have been analyzed. The influence of the water flow path on thermal comfort is insignificant. The average operative temperature for all the cases investigated varies between 28.1 and 29.2°C. The operative temperature is always within the 90% thermal comfort band. \nExperiment Setup:\nThe Department would like to congratulate Dharmasastha on the excellent achievement.

  "text": "Project Details\nSureFire: Smart Urban Resilience and Firefighting\nFunded by Hong Kong Research Grants Council Theme-based Research Scheme (9th Round) (HK$ 33.33 million)\nThe Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area has an urban environment of the high-density population that is inherently more sustainable and ideally suits smart city technologies. Increasing numbers of fires in tall buildings around the world have shown that the evolution of the built environment has changed the nature of the threat from fire. Urban environments are exposed to greater risk as prescriptive fire safety strategies are no longer fit for purpose. Firefighters are left facing an unpredictable hazard, that they are neither trained nor equipped to deal with, as the London Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 tragically demonstrated. On top of the human cost, costs due to losses from fire are estimated at approximately 1 per cent of global GDP per year.\nAs part of the smart city blueprint, the SureFire System adopts the complex data generating networks that enable real-time monitoring of the evolution of urban environments and hazards. Proper analysis of this data based on artificial intelligence can deliver information that continuously determines the state and evolution of systems and diagnoses emergent pathologies and support the decision making. Here, we gathered a multi-disciplinary team with leading local and international researchers and research laboratories, a government agency (FSD), and multiple high-tech companies to find answers to the fundamental research questions required to develop the foundational technology for a smart firefighting system that takes advantage of the rapidly evolving technology landscape of cyber-physical systems. Implementation of such a system for smart firefighting will help Hong Kong achieve the status of the world's leading smart city.",

We have been serving Hong Kong’s building services engineering industry ever since, promoting sustainable, efficient and healthy indoor and urban living environments in one of the world’s greatest cities by providing world class teaching and conducting internationally leading research. BEEE is one of the constituent departments of the Faculty of Construction and Environment, and offers a full range of taught and research based study programmes leading to awards from Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) to Masters (MSc and MEng) right up to Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).\nAmong many challenges confronting the world, perhaps the most critical is to provide high quality living environments to rapidly urbanising and ageing populations under the creeping threat of a worsening climate and increasing environmental pollution. UN forecasts that the world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050. 70% of the people are projected to live in urban areas, placing enormous strain on cities and the environment. To deal effectively with these challenges, future building engineers will need to be data savvy and work in interdisciplinary teams to deliver optimal solutions enabling smart urban environments incorporating elements such as vertical farms; renewables driven integrated buildings and transport systems; citywide recycling and so on for a sustainable planet and a smart and resilient built environment. In order to promote this vision, we have designed state of the art study programmes providing the best possible training to our students in designing high performance buildings and building systems through judicious exploitation of the sciences and contemporary technologies such as sensor and comms networks, AI and IoT techniques, data science and programming, BIM and digital twin systems etc. This is consistent with our mission, stated as, to imagine, engineer and promote sustainable, salutogenic and safe environments for human habitation.\nBEEE full-time academic and teaching staff members engage in a wide range of research activities organized in the following three research themes:\nBuilding Energy: Energy issues in buildings are addressed in the context of both demand and supply to improve the sustainability of the built environment.\nBuilding Environment: Optimisation of buildings and built environments for thermal comfort, indoor air quality, visual/spatial and vibration/acoustic aspects to improve occupant health and productivity.\nBuilding Safety and Resilience: Protection of building occupants from hazards such as fire and lightning to improve safety and resilience of communities, buildings and built environments.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in our department and programmes and hope you’ll join us in learning to promote smarter urban environments for a better and more sustainable future for humanity and our planet.\nProf. Asif Usmani\nHead of Unit\nDepartment of Building Environment and Energy Engineering",
