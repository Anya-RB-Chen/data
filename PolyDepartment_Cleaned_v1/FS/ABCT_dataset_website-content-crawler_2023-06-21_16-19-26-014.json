  "text": "The breastfeeding rate in Hong Kong has been increasing steadily over the past 20 years. As the source of a variety of nutrients, breast milk plays a vital role in the healthy growth and development of infants. The Research Institute for Future Food (RiFood) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has conducted a study to analyse the three-day dietary records and breast milk samples of Hong Kong lactating women. \nThe research has revealed that only 4% of lactating women had dietary habits that met the recommendation from the Department of Health to consume at least two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day, or the recommended intake of vitamin A, according to the “Chinese Dietary Reference Intake” which was established by the Chinese Nutrition Society. There was a significant correlation between dietary intake and the nutrient levels of breast milk, especially the carotenoid and polyphenol contents.\nAs explained by the research team, the first 1,000 days from pregnancy to a two-year-old infant is the basis for establishing long-term health. Breast milk contains a variety of nutrients and plays an important role in their healthy growth.\nProf. WONG Man-sau, Steering Committee Member of RiFood and Professor of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology of PolyU said, “Apart from commonly known nutrients, such as protein and fatty acids, breast milk also contains phytonutrients such as carotenoids and polyphenols. These phytonutrients are important in the physical development of infants and can reduce the level of inflammation. Lacking one or more nutrients may weaken the immune system of infants, and may also increase their risk of getting chronic diseases in the future.”\nThe PolyU research team collected breast milk samples and a three-day dietary record of about 90 lactating women and analysed the levels of carotenoid and polyphenol content.\nThe level of carotenoids in breast milk was higher in lactating women who had a higher intake of fruits and vegetables. Dr Christine LI, Teaching Fellow of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology of PolyU, said some carotenoids can be converted to vitamin A to promote the development of infants’ brain, vision and immunity, and can also protect the retina from damage by strong light.\nDr Daisy ZHAO, Assistant Professor of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology of PolyU, said polyphenol is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound, which can prevent cardiometabolic diseases and reduce the risk of bacterial infection.\nBased on the research findings, Dr Kenneth LO, Assistant Professor of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology of PolyU, suggested lactating women should enhance the levels of carotenoids and polyphenols in breast milk through increasing their fruit and vegetable intake. Common dark green vegetables, including Chinese flowering cabbage, spinach, Chinese kale, Indian lettuce, sweet potatoes, carrots, pumpkins, papayas, mangoes etc., are rich in phytonutrients.\nA new research project “Feeding mom feeding infants” has been launched by the research team, recruiting about 100 pairs of lactating women and infants for a one-year study, to further investigate the relationship between the dietary habits of lactating women and the nutrients of breast milk, gut microbiota composition of infants and their growth.",

  "text": "Nuclear magnetic resonance is a physical phenomenon exhibited by atomic nuclei having odd numbers of protons or neutrons. These nuclei have an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum. They can absorb or emit electro-magnetic (EM) radiation when placed in a magnetic field. The most receptive and commonly measured nuclei are hydrogen-1 (1H). Other nuclei such as carbon-13 (13C), 19F, 14N, 15N, 19F, 31P, 17O, 35Cl, 195Pt can also be measured.\nThe frequency of EM radiation absorbed or emitted is known as the NMR resonant frequency. The NMR resonant frequency of a particular nucleus is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field that the nucleus is in. The NMR resonant frequency is also influenced by the magnetic field exerted by NMR active nuclei near-by. The slight differences of the NMR resonant frequency of the same atomic nuclei is a hint of the chemical environment of the nuclei and chemist use this information to speculate the chemical structure of molecules.\n\t\t\nBruker Advance-III \t600 MHz FT-NMR System \tY1308a\t\nBruker Advance-III \t400 MHz FT-NMR System \tY1308a\t",

The Award aims to give recognition to distinguished graduates of PolyU in their chosen fields, active support to their alma mater, as well as impactful contributions to the wider community. We are pleased to announce that Prof. Edman Tsang Shik-chi has been selected as the recipient of the Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award 2022 in scholarly achievement.\nProf. Edman Tsang Shik-chi, Professor of Inorganic Chemistry and Director of the Wolfson Catalysis Centre of the University of Oxford, is a world-leading expert in chemical materials and green catalysis. He has published over 450 papers in refereed publications including Science and Nature, and his works have been widely cited. Decorated with numerous international awards and a proud owner of 16 patents, he was among the world’s pioneering researchers in nanomaterials, including the synthesis and catalytic properties of carbon nanotubes. Not only have his seminal works on opening and filling carbon nanotubes sparked global attention on nanomaterials, but he is also the first known scientist to modify carbon nanotubes with biological enzymes or related biomaterials. Recently focusing on green chemistry and catalysis, he is a co-founder of OXGRIN, a spin-out from Oxford University that is building a world-class One-Stop Catalyst Platform. \nDespite residing overseas, Prof. Tsang never ceases to forge links between his alma mater and industry. Apart from coaching staff and providing specialist advice to departments, he also actively collaborates with PolyU researchers on various projects in Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, Applied Physics, Electrical Engineering and other contexts. Thanks to his liaison efforts, PolyU has established closer relationships with Oxford University, government bodies and foreign tech enterprises.\nLet’s congratulate Prof. Tsang on winning the award!",

  "text": "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. It kills more people than AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined, which accounted for 7-8 million deaths each year. The global annual cancer incidence will exceed 20 million by 2020 and 10 million annual deaths are expected.\nSurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are the three basic treatments of cancer while surgery remains standard of care for treating most cancers. Unfortunately, most cancer cases, in particular those of lung cancer and liver cancer, are not diagnosed until the later stages of development, by which time surgery is no longer possible and treatment options thus become more limited. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy destroy both cancer cells and normal cells. Their general side effects include anemia, hair loss, oral ulcer, nausea and vomiting. There is an obvious need to identify new and better therapeutic agents.\nThe Lo Ka Chung Research Centre for Natural Anti-Cancer Drug Development is established in late 2006. Through out the years the centre has carried out pioneering research in natural anti-cancer drugs, and has contributed directly to the community by promoting educational training. So far, the centre has developed two novel drugs to treat cancer. The second drug (BCA-PEG20), which represents a new paradigm for treating many cancer types, has been awarded the Prize of the State of Geneva and Gold Medal with Jury’s Commendation at the 37th International Exhibition of Inventions, New Techniques and Products of Geneva in 2009. We have formulated the drug with state-of-the-art DNA technology and protein modification and significantly prolonged its half-life for therapeutic use. The use of this new drug will open up many new opportunities for treating different types of cancers.\nPlease click here to find more about our equipments and facilities",

  "text": "Hello! My name is Elena Bolonova and I’m originally from Russia. Currently I’m a year 1 PhD student at the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology (ABCT) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).\nPolyU was my first choice for postgraduate studies because of its excellent research opportunities and international environment, which I believed would greatly facilitate knowledge sharing, research advancement and personal growth. \nResearch projects in PolyU, in particular those in the field of Biological Science and Chemical Technology, are of current importance and impactful. My current project aims to study β-lactamases, enzymes responsible for resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin), and their inhibitor-resistant variants. Hopefully, our project outcomes can be applied to optimize the drug development in the future. Through various exposure at ABCT laboratory, we are able to equip ourselves with the knowledge, techniques, and problem-solving skills necessary for a successful career in chemistry and biotechnology. I found that working in the laboratory at ABCT actually motivates me to set my ultimate career goals; to make impact to the society, to contribute to the satisfaction of human needs and to improve our quality of life.\nBesides professional growth, getting familiar with different cultures and languages while living in the campus and student hall is another unique and fruitful experience you can get in PolyU. Even though Hong Kong is in the heart of Asia, PolyU postgraduate students do not have to worry about the language barrier, as the postgraduate programme would be entirely in English. Throughout my time at PolyU, I have also received the warmest support and advice from my supervisor and fellow students.\nHKPFS gives PhD students an amazing chance to pursue their academic and research goals, while enjoying multicultural atmosphere at the same time. I am thankful to the Research Grants Council, PolyU and ABCT for providing this opportunity to me, because without it I would not be able to start an amazing journey in Hong Kong!",

  "text": "Principal Investigators: Dr. Tang Cheuk On, Johnny\nThe main emphasis of my research team mainly involves three areas. The first aspect is about exploring the use of natural plant or animal products as novel anti-cancer agents and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of their anti-cancer actions. The second part mainly concerns with the chemical modifications of the identified active ingredients from the natural products with prominent anti-cancer effects for the purpose of novel drug discovery. The other research interest is to study the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to identify the novel molecular targets for the future targeted therapy on ESCC and other cancers.\nExploring Natural Products as Anti-cancer Agents\nStudied examples include the investigation on the anti-cancer effects of the extracts of Gleditsia sinensis, Ganoderma lucidum, Brucea javanica, Scutellaria barbata, Radix Sophorae tonkinensis and Mylabris phalerata. The molecular targets include the suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 and oncogenes expression, inhibition of telomerase activity and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.\nDiscovery of Novel Small-Molecule Anti-cancer Drugs\nCantharidin derived from Mylabris phalerata extract was further chemically modified to produce the derivatives which are less toxic and more potent to be used as novel anti-cancer agents. The molecular targets of the anti-cancer include decreased G1 phase cell population, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, caspase 3 activation and hence DNA fragmentation.\nMolecular Pathogenesis of Esophageal Carcinoma\nEsophageal cancer ranks the ninth most common malignancy and the sixth most frequent cancer death throughout the world, with special geographic variations in its incidence and histological subtypes. In China, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for more than 90% of the total incidence of esophageal cancer, and it has been estimated that approximately 300,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed every year in the world and nearly half of these cases originate in the high-incidence regions of China. In Hong Kong, ESCC ranks the sixth most frequent cancer death among all other cancers in male, which makes this tumor type of local importance for investigation.\nMy research group recently identified the novel oncogenes in ESCC (e.g. GAEC1, JK-1 and JS-1) and the normal cells can be transformed into tumor cells when the target oncogenes are overxpressed. The identified genes were also investigated as the novel targets for anti-cancer agents.\nRelated Publications:\nKok SHL, Chui CH, Lam WS, Chen J, Lau FY, Wong RSM, Cheng GYM, Lai PPS, Leung TWT, Yu MWY, Tang JCO*, Chan ASC.

  "text": "Principal Investigators: Prof. Thomas Leung and Dr. Thomas Lo\nFurther to our pervious success, we have designed another potential anti-cancer agent based on the naturally occurring enzyme, arginase, originating from an extreme thermophilic bacterium. Using the state-of-the-art DNA technology and site specific pegylated technologies we have rationally designed and synthesized BCA-PEG20, an effective, safe, highly stable drug with potent anti-cancer activities.\nThe main constituent of BCA-PEG20 is arginase, an enzyme that degrades arginine. Arginine is necessary for cell growth; it can be produced by normal cells in the human body. However, restriction of arginine inhibits growth of cancer cells, because these cancer cells are unable to produce arginine so they extract it instead from the blood. Depleting arginine in the blood thus starves cancer cells to death while normal cells are unaffected.\nBCA-PEG20 has potent anti-cancer activities on a variety of cancers, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, gastric and esophageal cancers. Our drug also shows synergy with chemo drugs to enhance therapeutic effects. This invention has awarded the Prize of the State of Geneva and a Gold Medal with Jury’s Commendation in the 37th International Exhibition of Invention, New Techniques and Products in Geneva in 2009.

  "text": "Principal Investigator: Prof. Li Pei, Pauline\n1) Development of nanocarriers for gene and drug deliveries\nWe have established a core-shell particle platform technology which allows us to design and synthesize highly uniform particles in nano- to micro-scaled sizes with different physical and chemical properties. One of the research areas in our group is to develop non-viral polyethyleneimine-based nanocarriers for gene and drug deliveries. Our PEI-based amphiphilic core-shell nanoparticles show great potential to be efficient nanocarriers for deliveries of plasmid DNA and drugs. We have also synthesized a gelatin/PEI core-shell nanogel as a new type of siRNA nanocarrier. Results show that the gelatin/PEI core-shell nanogel particles can effectively deliver the siRNA molecules to the site of function and knock-down the gene of interest.\nResearch Highlights in Biointerphases\nFeatured Article in Global Medical Discovery\nSelected Publications:\nHetti Mimi, Kin Man Ho, Yuen Shan Siu, Aihua Wu and Pei Li*, “Polyethyleneimine-Based Core-Shell Nanogels: A Promising siRNA Carrier for Argininosuccinate Synthetase mRNA Knockdown in HeLa Cells”, Journal of Controlled Release, 158, 123-130 (2012)\nYuen Shan Siu, Lijun Li, Man Fai Leung, Kam Len Daniel Lee, and Pei Li*, “Polyethyleneimine-Based Amphiphilic Core-Shell Nanoparticles: Study of Gene Delivery and Intracellular Trafficking”, Biointerphases, 7, 16 (2012).\nPei Li*, Yuen Shan Siu, Kin Man Ho, Wei Li, “Amphiphilic Core-Shell Nanoparticles Containing Hairy Polyethyleneimine Shells as Effective Nanocarriers for Gene Delivery”, Book chapter in the “Selected Topics in Nanomedicine” published by World Scientific Publishing, (In press, 2012).\nMin Feng, Pei Li*, “Amine-containing core-shell nanoparticles as potential drug carriers for intracellular delivery”, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, 80, 184-193 (2007).\nJunmin Zhu, Angie Tang, Lai Pang Law, Min Feng, Kin Man Ho, Daniel Kam Len Lee, Frank W.

It adopts a type of magnetic core-shell (MCS) composite particles, which can selectively bind endotoxin in protein mixtures and are easily removed by a magnetic separation. The endotoxin level of the treated protein solution is low enough (< 10 EU/mL) to allow for further process, analyze or even administrate to mammals.\nOur method has the following advantages:\nHigh selectivity for endotoxin adsorption in both basic and acidic protein mixtures (e.g. bovine serum albumin).\nEffective in broad working conditions (different pHs, electrolyte concentrations and buffer types).\nSimple process which does not require multiple extraction steps (unlike Triton X-114 extraction method).\nLow cost, avoiding the use of expensive reagent (e.g., polylysine).\nFast purification process without common problems such as filter blocking in microfiltration and time-consuming process when using porous adsorbents.\nSelected Publications:\nKin Man Ho, Pei Li*, “Selective endotoxin nanosorbents, and a method of removing endotoxin by using amphiphilic core-shell nanosoorbents”, U.S. Patent Application (Pending, 2011).\nKin Man Ho, Pei Li*, “Design and Synthesis of Novel Magnetic Core-Shell Polymeric Particles”, Langumir, 24, 1801-1807 (2008).",

The minimum number of credits required for graduation from this programme is 63, including the mandatory 9 credits of GUR. In addition, students must satisfy other prevailing university (and programme) requirements for graduation.\n7. On top of the formal curriculum, students are required to complete a Work\u0002Integrated Education (WIE) component in their programme of study. WIE is intended to provide students with an exposure and working experience in sciences-related industrial/commercial sectors or in areas deemed as appropriate by the WIE Group.\n7.1 On completion of WIE, students will be able to achieve one or more of the following WIE learning outcomes: \n(i) acquire practical experience \n(ii) integrate knowledge and link up theories with practice \n(iii) have effective communication skills \nDepending on the different job nature, and the contract between individual student and the company, students may also acquire the following outcomes: \n(iv) have critical thinking and analytical mind \n(v) have effective information management skills \n(vi) function as a competent member in a multi-disciplinary team \n(vii) learn and acquire the ethical standards in the professional attributes \n7.2 WIE component is mandatory. Students who do not complete this component satisfactorily will not be considered for the graduation award. Students are required to complete 2 training credits, each equivalent to 60 working hours. \n7.3 The attainment of intended learning outcomes will be assessed based on student’s reports and employer/supervisor’s evaluations. Exemption may be considered and to be approved by the WIE Group if student can provide evidence of sufficient experience of working in the related fields.\n7.4 The WIE can be in different formats deemed appropriate by the WIE Group. These should include, but not limited to, internship, block placement, cooperative project, research exchange, community service, summer jobs and part-time employments secured by students themselves, which are relevant to students’ future profession or to the development of generic skills as required by the analytical science professions.",
