Facilitated by the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies (CBS), the agreement marks PolyU as the first official CATTI test center in Hong Kong, and CBS is responsible for the management and organization of the test.\nLaunched in 2003, CATTI is the only language test incorporated into China’s national vocational qualification system. Candidates who pass the test will obtain a Qualification Certificate of Proficiency issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS) and CICG. The test is designed to access the proficiency and competence of candidate translators and interpreters, and it is widely recognised by employers throughout the country. Last year, over 350,000 candidates took the test.\nSince 1988, CBS has been committed to uplifting the professional standard of Chinese-English translation in Hong Kong. We offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses of translation, and our Centre for Translation Studies is designated to provide training for the English-Chinese translation and interpreting test in CATTI. With PolyU organising the CATTI test in Hong Kong, we will continue to cultivate talents in languages and translation, and promote the development of the translation industry in Hong Kong and the Mainland.\nThe first English-Chinese translation and interpreting test in Hong Kong will be held during 5-6 November 2022. Applications are welcome until 10 October 2022. For details, please visit https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/cts/en/catti/. \nMedia coverage: PolyU Press Release, Ta Kung Pao (in Chinese only)",

  "text": "CBS Teaching Excellence Award is an annual award set up by the department to recognise, reward and promote quality and effective teaching by CBS academic and full-time teaching staff during the assessment period from 1 July to 30 June every year.\nYear of CBS Teaching Excellence Award\tIndividual Award Winner(s)\t\nTeaching Philosophy/Methods\n\t\n2021/22\t\nDr HSU Yu-Yin\nAssistant Professor\nTeaching Excellence Award|Video\n\t\nMy teaching philosophy is eclectic. I try to be flexible in applying whatever pedagogical strategies are most suited to the individual students in the class and to the nature of the course. \nIn my view, studying linguistics is learning to look at things from different angles, to categorize and analyze observations, and to practice critical thinking. I think effective learning occurs when students feel that they are engaged in the curriculum, and when they learn actively. It is always a great fun for students to realize that not every person speaks and thinks in the same way. In turn, students have a chance to express their experience and their opinions on language diversity, and to enjoy and appreciate the fact that studying in the university is more than learning the knowledge – it is also about learning to appreciate and understand different views, especially when the views are very different from our own or from what we used to assume.\nFor me, teaching and learning inform each other. I have constantly been inspired and intrigued by new research ideas that arise from conversations with my students. I believe that when the instructor is passionate about a subject, it becomes easier to arouse the interest and curiosity of students and to motivate them to learn and study. In all courses, I try to incorporate technology component in course activates; this method not only helps to raise students’ learning interests, but also helps students to develop the ability to accommodate different types of learning modes, which will eventually help them to acquire multimodal skills that will be critical for their future development in life and career.\n\t\n\t\n2020/21 \nDr LIU Kanglong\nAssistant Professor\nTeaching Excellence Award|Video\nThe fundamental principles that guide my teaching practice can be summarized as SPIRIT, which stands for Student-Centred Teaching and Learning, Provision of Ample Opportunities to Develop Skills in Translation, Innovative Teaching for Effective Learning, Real-world Connections in Teaching, Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Learning, and Thoughtfulness, Tolerance and Trustworthiness.\nThe primary goal of student-centred teaching and learning is to overcome the issues inherent in more traditional forms of education by developing a variety of teaching activities to pique learners' interests and meet their learning needs. In my translation classes, I have designed a range of in-class activities such as online translation competitions, group discussions, and analysis of real-world translations, apart from giving lectures. I have also valued out-of-class activities such as the online translation forum (where students are encouraged to complete a small translation task on a weekly basis), and short training seminars using computer tools (which students can volunteer to join). In all of these activities, students play the central role, take responsibility for their own learning and set their own pace.\nAs translation is a highly practical trade that requires professional knowledge in many fields, teachers need to bring real-world training to their students instead of focusing on textbook knowledge. In this respect, I have valued the input of real-world examples and data in the translation classroom. For example, in the legal translation course I teach, I have created a parallel corpus that includes all of Hong Kong's bilingual legislative texts. These texts have served as effective teaching materials and learning aids for students to investigate the translation strategies of various legal terminologies, modal verbs, and even archaisms. The incorporation of real-world content piques students' interest in the subject and assists them in gaining a thorough understanding of the practice of translation.\n\n2019/20 \nDr Sun-A KIM\nAssociate Professor\nI believe that human potential is prodigious, and an inspiring teacher enables any person to move to the next level at any point of life. I have adopted application-oriented and diversifying approaches for my classroom teaching and my evaluation of students in my courses – my undergraduate courses on Korean/East Asian culture/society, and postgraduate courses on teaching Chinese to non-native speakers. \nFirst, to empower students to find their identity and grow as well-rounded persons and competent professionals, I employ an application-oriented method. In all of my courses, the assessment methods include at least one task requiring the students to apply what they have learned in class to their own lives in the form of a project, a reflective journal, a teaching demonstration, or actual in-class teaching. In the process of reflection and application, students actively search for issues and solutions closely relevant to them and discover who they are and what they are interested in. To guide students on the right track, I provide students with frequent feedback and comments on their ongoing work. \nSecond, I diversify my teaching and assessment methods for students’ proactive and self-directed learning and active engagement in the class. For example, in my Korean/East Asian culture/society courses, I invite guest speakers in and outside of Hong Kong and organize field trips, which has been possible after receiving a series of external grants and securing sponsorships from Korean national institutes/governmental organizations. \nI have been leading the Korean minor program since 2010 and the MA program in Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (MATCFL) since 2017. Also, I have received external learning and teaching grants (over HKD 1.5 million) as the PI and internal learning and teaching grants (approximately HKD 300,000) as the (Co-)PI since 2011. Undergraduate students whom I coached with Korean teaching fellows were the awardees or finalists of the most prestigious Korean speech contest in Hong Kong. Finally, I shared and disseminated effective teaching approaches and practices that I have developed with my collaborators by publishing a monograph, journal articles, and book chapters.\n\n2017/18 \nDr Reijiro AOYAMA \nSenior Research Fellow\nIn my teaching I make it a point to 1) help my students embrace intercultural perspectives, and 2) connect my classes to the real world by using online tools, digital technologies, real-life source materials and authentic tasks to drive student interest, engagement and critical thinking.\nI aim for my students to not only know the terms and concepts related to the course but, more importantly, to put these concepts to critical use via real-world challenges. I make effective use of collaborative tasks in which students need to interact with one another to accomplish authentic activities in social contexts, for example, generating their own digital videos, or creating and publishing Wikipedia entries in Japanese.\n\nDr Cindy NGAI\nAssociate Professor\nA good teacher is passionate about both knowledge and people. Teachers genuinely interested in people can adopt a learner-centred pedagogy by first understanding their students’ aptitudes, interests, and learning styles, and then identifying the best approach to impart knowledge to them. Maintaining an interactive teaching and learning environment, and aligning the teaching content, methodology, and assessment methods with the learning objectives and outcomes of the subjects is the bare minimum expected of teachers. \nTo me, good teaching can be encapsulated using an acronym: C.A.R.E. As an educator, we should care for our students. Caring does not entail pleasing students but rather enabling students to find their own pathway to success through activities and tasks that unlock their Creativity, teaching in an Articulated manner, focusing on developing students’ Reasoning skills, and challenging students with Enlightening ideas. In terms of pedagogical design, my lessons focus on these four grand pillars: Creating, Articulating, Reasoning, and Enlightening. In my class, problematic cases or scenarios are provided to students to enable them to unleash their untapped creativity and apply their problem-solving skills while concrete guidelines and instructions are presented in a bid to help students to draw their own conclusions. \nIn addition, students are required to reflect on tasks and are challenged by others’ ideas to enlighten their understanding of the knowledge taught. Therefore, in the classroom, I often ask students to discuss and reflect, criticise and analyse with an aim to promote a self-discovery of knowledge. Any questions or relevant points made by students lead in some way toward the discovery of knowledge, which generates a solid sense of ownership. When this occurs, students experience the joy of learning and are well on their way to becoming independent and life-long learners.",

To graduate CBS students with a global perspective, outbound exchange is an important dimension of their learning outcomes. Apart from honing their communication skills in (Mandarin) Chinese and/or English, student exchange experience is known to correlate with the development of CBS graduates’ other attributes such as leadership and cross-cultural awareness. Where possible, therefore, all CBS students are encouraged to plan and actualize outbound exchange for one semester or two during their undergraduate studies. Their endeavor will be supported by the Department. For more information, all CBS students are welcome to seek advice from their Academic Advisor.\nInternationalization may also take place on our campus. This may be achieved by attracting inbound exchange students. The CBS Department welcomes inquiry for inbound exchange to PolyU, especially from students studying in any of our partner universities. For inquiry, interested students or faculty members from our partner universities are welcome to contact our colleagues at GEO (Global Engagement Office).",

The SLS Lab is equipped with a Compumedics Neuroscan EEG system with 128/64-channel SynAmpsRT amplifiers. The lab has Curry 7 software for acquisition of EEG data, along with several stimulus presentation software packages (including STIM2, E-Prime, and Presentation), and can record behavioural responses via mouse and keyboard, button box, or microphone.\nEyelink 1000 Plus Eye Tracker\nThe EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracker allows researchers to track precise eye movements of a participant during a reading task to understand language processing. It has a desktop mount to stabilize the participant’s head during the experiment. It also supports the remote free-to-move mode using stickers. An iMac is paired up with the eye tracker for using the software Experiment Builder and Data Viewer to present stimuli and analyse data.\n2 PC workstations\nEach of the two PC workstations is equipped with a sound interface, a condenser microphone and a pair of headphones for recording speech and performing behavioral experiments.\nBioSemi 32-channel EEG system\nSimilar to the Compumedics Neuroscan EEG system, the BioSemi EEG system collects brainwaves data. It is a portable EEG system that allows the researcher to conduct EEG experiments with a 32-channel EEG cap.\nTobii TX300 Eye Tracker\nThe Tobii TX300 eye tracker is a portable equipment that can capture eye movements of the participant. It is user-friendly and has a simple calibration process. Tobii is located at SLS Lab (Annex) .\nInteracoustic AS608 Audiometer\nThe Interacoustics AS608 screening audiometer is used to test the hearing sensitivity of a participant before perception experiments.\nSoterix Medical 1x1 tDCS & 4x1 HD-tDCS \nThe Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) system is mainly used for research on rehabilitation of neurogenic communication disorders, for example, dysarthria, aphasia and stuttering. The tDCS modulates the brain activity through low levels of constant current. The SLS Lab provides two types of stimulators: 1x1 tDCS and 4x1 HD-tDCS adaptors. The 1x1 tDCS aims to deliver low current to cover a broad area of the brain, whereas the 4x1 HD-tDCS targets a particular and profound region of the brain. \nGlottal Enterprises Electroglottograph\nThe electroglottograph (EGG) is a device used for non-invasive measurement of the degree of contact between the vocal folds during voice production. The EGG device measures the translaryngeal electrical impedance between two electrodes placed at adjacent locations on the surface of the neck. EGG is commonly used to assess pathological voice conditions by voice scientists.\nGlottal Enterprises Aeroview Phonatory Aerodynamics System\nThe phonatory aerodynamics system measures nasal airflow, oral airflow and subglottal pressure during speech and voice production. The phonatory aerodynamics system includes a handheld mask, transducers and a data acquisition box. It is often used to assess vocal cords and velopharyngeal port function.\nKarl Storz Stroboscopic Laryngoscopy System\nThe SLS Lab houses a medical stroboscopic laryngoscopy system to conduct voice-related and swallowing-related research studies. The stroboscopic imaging system allows speech therapists to visually inspect the conditions of the larynx during speech, phonation and swallowing. Our stroboscopic system includes a Full-HD medical grade surgical monitor, rigid stroboscope telescope, flexible fiberscope, as well as imaging camera head and imaging console of the latest technology.\nEsaote MyLabGamma Ultrasound System\nThe MyLabGamma Ultrasound system is highly portable and provides excellent imaging quality. Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technology that could provide real-time visual feedback of the configuration of the tongue or the larynx of an individual during speech, phonation and swallowing. It is highly useful for speech pathologists to provide holistic assessment and treatment to patients with speech-language disorders and voice disorders.\nCarstens AG501 Three-Dimensional Electromagnetic Articulography\nThe Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) is used for precise kinematic measurement of the articulators (lips, tongue and jaw) during speech and swallowing. Such measurement is performed by using a magnetic field to localize the positions of transducers (sensors) temporarily attached to the articulators. EMA is commonly used for research studies related to articulation and swallowing disorders. \nSoftware\nThe SLS Lab provides the following software for designing experiments and analyzing data:\nE-prime (version 2.0 Professional & version 3.0)\nNeurobehavioral Systems Presentation\nBESA\nMATLAB\nSPSS\nFor students and CBS staff who would like to gain access to the SLS Lab for conducting linguistic experiments, please fill in the application form in the following link. Afterwards, you will need to attend a short briefing on how to use the equipment and familiarize yourself with the lab rules.\nApplication form of lab access: https://www.polyu.edu.hk/pfs/index.php/623196?lang=en\nThe SLS Lab uses an online platform for booking the booth spaces (authorized faculty members only).\nAll CBS staff and students may use the facilities free of charge.

  "text": "About CBS \nMessage from CBS \nThe Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies (CBS), formerly known as the Department of Chinese, Translation and Interpretation, was established in 1988. Our department is one of the leading academic departments in Asia that studies Chinese and its interaction with English. It addresses real-life language issues in a bilingual society. As a department with two undergraduate programmes, several taught postgraduate programmes, and a PhD programme, CBS has come a long way and is now a widely recognized innovative pioneer in establishing academic programmes that are underpinned by our research while meeting the demands in society. Among our best-known milestones are the first MA in Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (MATCFL) programme and the first Master of Speech Therapy (MST) programme in Hong Kong (professional entry qualification fully accredited by the Hong Kong Institute of Speech Therapists, HKIST).\nAs an active, research-oriented department, CBS has been strong in the research areas of Chinese linguistics, corpus linguistics, language and communication disorders, cognitive neuroscience, bilingual communication, Chinese language education, Chinese language testing, language technology, and translation and interpreting.\nAs a responsible member of the community, CBS constantly provides services to the people of Hong Kong, especially to those in need. For example, we have special programmes that help South Asian school children in Hong Kong to learn Chinese; we offer Chinese and Putonghua tests for local primary and secondary school students; and we provide speech therapy service to children suffering from communication disorders or learning deficiencies.\nMission\nThe Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies (CBS) pledges:\nTo offer high-quality academic programmes\nthat produce professionally trained graduates equipped with transnational vision, creativity and advanced communication skills in multilingual and multicultural work settings;\nTo conduct applied research\nthat contributes to the study of Chinese in a bilingual context as well as bilingualism in a Chinese context, incorporating modern views and methods in disciplines related to such research; and\nTo provide professional services to the community\u0003\nrelevant to the needs of Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland and beyond by engaging in consultancy projects and other forms of community service to people in need.",

The Symposium is organised by the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies and the PolyU – Peking U Research Centre on Chinese Linguistics (P2U2 ReCCL), Faculty of Humanities, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\nThe goal of this symposium is to present the recent works from a group of young scholars who are actively pursuing this line of data-driven research in Chinese linguistics. The talks have been arranged to represent a cross-examination of the mutualistic nature between the Chinese language and data in different genres (social media, news, biomedicine and politics, etc.) and from different analytical perspectives (lexical, discourse, quantitative and computational modeling, etc.). Through an interdisciplinary exploration and analysis of Chinese language data, the symposium seeks to advance our understanding of human communications, cognitive values, sensory perception of language, and awareness of how we compose and construct language to achieve social and emotional objectives.\nThe keynote address will be delivered by Dr. Shu-Kai HSIEH, Associate Professor of Linguistics at National Taiwan University. Dr. Hsieh will introduce the most recent development of Chinese Wordnet (CWN), and recent efforts in leveraging the LangChain framework to chain various large language models (LLMs) with CWN and other lexical resources. Experimental results of the lexical knowledge retrieval from the LLMs, and different sense-aware NLP tasks with the augmented language models will be reported.\nIn addition, this exciting one-day symposium will feature fifteen talks offered by researchers with expertise in Chinese linguistics and digital humanities.

Please complete all relevant fields on the application form and upload all necessary documents.\nThe Master of Speech Therapy (MST) programme cultivates graduates who will be able to practise as speech therapists in Hong Kong and serve as speech therapy advocates in mainland China and the Macau SAR. The programme is designed to equip students with the professional and academic knowledge base, clinical and research skills, and attitudes and ethics required to function effectively as entry-level speech therapists. The curriculum offers a unique approach to education and training in Cantonese, Mandarin and English, addressing speech therapy in both Chinese and bilingual contexts. Speech therapy Master’s level programmes are widely adopted as entry-level degrees in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, the MST programme provides an pathway for Bachelor’s degree holders to enter the speech therapy profession.\nThe MST teaching team is composed of academic and teaching staff with considerable teaching experience, proven research track records and extensive clinical expertise. We adopt a hybrid teaching and learning approach: traditional lectures are conducted in the first year, and the problem based learning (PBL) approach is adopted in the second year. This enhances the integration of learning across courses and enables students to put their theoretical knowledge into practice.\nA vital part of the training for speech therapists involves supervised clinical practice. A Speech Therapy Unit (STU) has been established on the PolyU campus. The STU offers a platform for both in-house teaching and research through a service interface. For more details, please visit the STU’s website here.\nThe clinical placements in the MST programme are scheduled to occur throughout the 2.5 years of the whole programme. They will cover the assessment and treatment of speech, language, literacy, voice, fluency and swallowing disorders of clinical populations, varying in age from infancy to old age. To prepare students to work in different speech therapy service settings upon graduation, clinical placements are arranged not only at STU, but also with clinical education partners such as the Hospital Authority, non-government organisations, special and mainstream schools and other community service providers.",

Apart from 30 GUR credits in Table 1, students need to accumulate another 93 credits by completing\n75 DSR credits plus 3 training credits listed in Tables 2 and 3, with at least 21 credits from level-4 subjects, and\n18 elective credits from any academic departments of the University.\nHowever, students have the option of completing all the remaining 18 credits from courses offered within the BALT programme including subjects listed in Tables 3, 4 and 5.\nThe Major and Minor Pathway\nA BALT award with a Major in BALT and a Minor in a chosen area requires the accumulation of a minimum of 123 academic credits plus 3 training credits. In addition to the 30 GUR credits in Table 1, students need to accumulate another 93 credits by completing\n75 DSR credits plus 3 training credits listed in Tables 2 and 3, with at least 21 credits from level-4 subjects, and\n18 credits by completing six relevant subjects listed in Table 4 (Minor in Japanese) or Table 5 (Minor in Korean) or in any Minor programmes offered by ANOTHER department at PolyU. Among the 18 minor credits, at least 9 credits should be from subjects at Level 3 or above. A maximum of 6 credits from GUR subjects can be counted toward the Minor with the approval from the Minor-offering department. Under normal circumstances, the GPA of Minor subjects will not factor in the calculation of Major GPA.\nPlease note that students choosing this option will have to apply for a Minor. If they do not wish to declare a Minor, they should consider taking free electives, thus becoming a Single Discipline Major student (see above section on Single Discipline Major Pathway).\nThe Double Majors Pathway (between BALT and BA in English and Applied Linguistics)\nA Double Major in Linguistics and Translation and English and Applied Linguistics requires the accumulation of 168 relevant credits plus 3 training credits. In addition to the 30 GUR credits in Table 1, students need to complete\n75 DSR credits plus 3 training credits listed in Tables 2 & 3, and\n63 credits by completing at least 20 subjects (including all the compulsory subjects) offered by ENGL. Students who choose this academic pathway must earn 21 level-4 credits from BALT plus 21 level-4 credits from BAEAL. Double Major students will be exempted from taking WIE of the second Major.\nStudents are required to obtain an overall GPA of at least 1.70 for each of the 2 Majors, in order to satisfy the requirement for graduation with Double Majors. They will not be allowed to graduate with one of the 2 majors. The derivation of GPA for award classification for the First Major and Second Major (particularly on the counting subjects common to both Majors) will be decided by the Department offering the Major programme. Students will be given two award parchments, one for each Major programme, which will be issued upon completion of both majors. The honours classification of the two Major awards need not be identical. \nSecondary Major DetailsThe option of Secondary Major in AI and Data Analytics is available to the students of BA (Hons) in Linguistics and Translation.\nFeatures\nStudents who pursue this pathway will complete 75 academic credits + 3 training credits for the Primary Major (BALT) and 36 credits for the Secondary Major (AIDA). Certain credits including the Integrated Capstone Project can be double-counted between the Primary and Secondary Majors. The list of compulsory and elective subjects for the Primary Major (BALT) is almost the same as the existing programme BALT. The only difference is in the capstone project: students will complete an integrated capstone project (involving both BALT and AIDA) instead of the BALT regular capstone. The minimum credit requirement of BALT + AIDA is at least 132 credits.\nBALT curriculum focuses on the analysis of linguistic structures (speech sounds, words, sentences, and discourses in both Chinese and English), language processing by humans, and multiple functions of language in society. The curriculum also includes computer programming, text processing, computational linguistics, and language data analytics. This creates a natural connection with the AIDA curriculum. By extending BALT students’ exposure to include a cluster of more specialized subjects on IT and big data analytics, they will be in a privileged position to apply linguistic and data analytics skills in an increasingly bilingual professional workplace, thus enhancing their employability.\nAn important learning outcome of BALT is to train the students with empirical data analysis tool and computational methods. In the digital era, linguistic and IT-mediated skill sets are evidently in great demand. BALT graduates can make meaningful contributions to various sectors in the society (e.g. business, marketing, journalism and media, education, healthcare, public services, academic research) by analyzing social sentiments, spotting emergent trends, generating predictions, and providing corpus-based insights to facilitate corporate and administrative decision-making.\nThere is no professional accreditation for BALT+AIDA.",

It also helps readers understand some of the ways in which the Chinese language has undergone structural change as a result of Europeanization. The book begins with a review of Cantonese-English contrastive phonology and is followed by a detailed analysis of lexico-grammatical deviations found among Chinese ESL/EFL learners. It concludes with a brief history of the Europeanization of the Chinese language and a discussion of commonly encountered lingua-cultural problems encountered by Chinese users of English in intercultural communication settings.\nThis book is written primarily for teachers and students specializing in language-related disciplines. Scholars who wish to understand the acquisitional challenges for Chinese students in the process of learning English as an additional language will also find the book an informative reference.\nDavid C.

Seeking to identify the sets of universal and language-specific categories, it compares the range of categories available in Mandarin and the Indo-European languages and establishes six universal categories – nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions – and three language-specific ones, namely classifiers, localizers and sentence-final particles. Incorporating insights from recent research findings and the diachronic development of the language, the book sheds new light on the factors that contribute to the long-standing debate on the categorical status of adjectives, prepositions and localizers in the extant literature.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press\nA Reference Grammar of Chinese is a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to the linguistic structure of Chinese, covering all of the important linguistic features of the language and incorporating insights gained from research in Chinese linguistics over the past thirty years. With contributions from twenty-two leading Chinese linguists, this authoritative guide uses large-scale corpora to provide authentic examples based on actual language use. The accompanying online example databases ensure that a wide range of exemplars are readily available and also allow for new usages to be updated. This design offers a new paradigm for a reference grammar where generalizations can be cross-checked with additional examples and also provide resources for both linguistic studies and language learning. Featuring bilingual term lists, this reference grammar helps readers to access relevant literature in both English and Chinese and is an invaluable reference for learners, teachers and researchers in Chinese linguistics and language processing.",

  "text": "重點活動\nChair Professor Distinguished Lecture Series 2022/23 was held on December 7, 2022 at 10:30 a.m. via Zoom. An online research seminar entitled \"Changing Time, Enduring Language, 時恆變 語常在\", The Speaker: Prof. HUANG Chu-ren (Chair Professor of Applied Chinese Language Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University)\nAbstract:\nThese unanswerable questions by Qu Yuan 屈原 were posed more than 2,200 years before Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle in physics and Quine’s indeterminacy of meaning in the philosophy of language. They share similar dilemmas of how to account for changes, such as the impossibility of tracking the movement of one single electron between two time points. In general, changes are captured by comparing two instantiations of the same entity at two different points in the space-time continuum. This leads to a methodological dilemma: a description of changes presupposes that two instantiations remain the same by presenting empirical evidence showing that they are not. In addition, a modeling dilemma arises from the hidden order (Holland 1995) of self-organizing complex systems, where neither the behavior of the whole system nor that of each individual component can be described in isolation.\nI propose in this talk that the foundation of conceptualization is the ability to commit to the enduring identity of an entity over a space-time continuum, in spite of observable differences. In addition, language as a system of knowledge representation is built both on the cognitive ability to assign time-dependent variations (i.e. changes) to the same entity (i.e. the ontological commitment of identity that endures changes), as well as the ability to flip time-dependency of linguistic units (e.g. denominal nouns, or deverbal verbs).\nThe fundamental cognitive tool of manipulating time-dependency that I propose can be instantiated as the foundational endurant/perdurant (i.e. continuant/occurrent) bifurcation of formal ontologies, or as the SNAP/SPAN perspective alternations in knowledge representation. Using this foundational concept, many challenging linguistic issues can be resolved, and a few instances of conventional wisdom underlying the theoretical foundations in linguistics can be updated for better explanatory power.",

  "text": "Master of Speech Therapy (MST) is a full-time postgraduate programme launched in September 2013. The curriculum is designed to meet locally and internationally recognised standards with a good mix of traditional lectures, Problem Based Learning (PBL) tutorials and clinical practices. MST is an entry-level professional qualification. After successfully completing the programme, MST graduates are recognized as qualified for speech therapy practice in Hong Kong.\nProfessional Recognition:\nThe MST programme is the first speech therapy training programme in Hong Kong to be awarded the status of ‘Full Endorsement’ for five years by the Hong Kong Institute of Speech Therapists (HKIST) since the start of the institution-based assessment scheme in 2018. With the HKIST’s endorsement, MST graduates (including those who graduated before 2018), are eligible to apply to become ‘Members of the Register of Speech Therapists accredited by the Department of Health’.\nSpeech therapists provide assessment, treatment and consultation for individuals of different age groups with communication or swallowing disorders. To address the demand for speech therapy services across the lifespan, the government has committed to creating hundreds of new speech therapist posts in both child and adult service settings in the last few years. The manpower requirement of speech therapists is anticipated to grow further with the implementation of new rehabilitation initiatives associated with the ageing trend of the Hong Kong population.\nInformation Seminars\nDate: 7 January 2023 (Sat)\nLanguage: English\nSlides Video",

  "text": "「媽咪帶我去渣（沙）灘玩！」、「老闆，我已經交交交……交了報告。」無論小朋友咬字不清，或上班族說話「口窒窒」，均影響個人發展及自信。有言語治療師表示，曾有僱員因口吃，險些兒飯碗不保；亦有父母亂說英語教壞細路，令小朋友有口難言，導致學習遲緩。\n梁文德指，言語治療師會以字卡測試兒童咬字發音是否正確，從而糾正。\n兒童讀寫障礙、成人表達能力差，以至老人中風後吞嚥困難，全部也是言語治療師的服務對象。在港孩愈養愈矜貴及人口老化下，言語治療師更為「吃香」，起薪點約2.4萬元。\n今年首辦言語治療碩士課程的香港理工大學，其中文及雙語學系副教授梁文德表示，曾遇到金融機構前線員工來求助，因他有口吃，打電話與客戶溝通，3分鐘的話用10分鐘也說不完；發不到E音，老闆英文名叫Ian，他永遠說不出，因而險掉飯碗。\n一星期改善口吃\n梁說：「他幾乎被炒才來求助，但花了一星期就把口吃問題改善。」要改善口吃並不困難，重點是學會控制口吃的方法，並努力鍛練技巧。不過，若患者想以後不再口吃，則需徹底改變說話模式。而朋友的支持很重要，若經常被取笑表達能力差，亦會影響其表現。\n不擅表達除了影響職場表現，亦會影響兒童學習能力。香港言語治療師協會主席區志漾指，曾有家長為使兒子學好英語，硬把英文作為家中唯一溝通語言，結果小朋友4歲多仍不懂說話，只懂透過手勢和表情表達一切，影響學習進度。經評估後，發現小朋友有語言遲緩問題。\n全英語可礙學習\n他認為，非所有幼兒適合雙語發展，家長亦要注意本身英語水平，亂說英語反會干擾子女學習。如個案中的小朋友，本身智力正常，但外語的學習環境反而為他帶來心理障礙。假如自小以中文溝通和學習，他未必需要花上一年半才追回同齡兒童的表達及學習能力，可謂得不償失。\n不少家長望子成龍，但區志漾提醒，除非小朋友本身語言學習能力很強，否則不建議家長盲目強迫子女雙語學習，並建議家長多與子女玩遊戲，如「狐狸先生幾多點？」、「煮飯仔」等，增加溝通機會。\n兒童有語言遲緩問題，很多時會發錯音，如「沙」會讀成「打、渣」、「狗」讀作「豆」、「書」讀作「豬」。香港社區言語治療中心言語治療師主管高展鵬指，透過玩肥皂泡，可鍛練幼兒口部肌肉多活動，增靈活性。另唱歌、字卡學習等，在言語治療師指導下，可助改善語言遲緩及讀寫障礙問題。\n百分百就業 循3途徑入行\n目前全港有約600名言語治療師，每年畢業人數僅40人，就業率達100%，起薪點約2.4萬元，可謂薪優出路佳。梁文德表示，內地缺相關專業人士，致近年從內地來港求助的個案急升，私營醫療機構甚至願意調薪1至2成「挖角」。\n言語治療師除了可在公私營醫院從事醫療工作外，也可在特殊學校或特殊兒童保健教育中心工作，又或在大學擔任相關研究人員。以醫管局為例，薪金介乎2.4萬至5.4萬元，13/14年度會再增聘4至5人。\n梁稱，本港未有言語治療師註冊制度，目前只由香港言語治療師協會確定有關資歷。取得資格途徑有三︰\n1. 於香港大學修畢言語及聽覺科學學士學位課程；\n2. 持有海外言語治療相關學位，並註冊成為該國言語治療師，執業資格亦可在香港獲承認。\n3. 理工大學今年首辦言語治療全日制碩士課程，修讀年期為兩年半，學費為36萬元，課程名額不超過40人。報讀者如曾修讀醫科等相關學科，或曾從事特殊兒童或老人護理工作，將獲優先考慮；學生須完成350至400小時督導實習。\n加強親子溝通 勝於一切\n科技日新月異，兒童玩具由毛公仔、積木變成平板電腦和智能手機，梁文德指，不少兒童日夜沉迷玩平板或手機遊戲，溝通能力每況愈下。\n現今有小朋友只會說「嗯」、「唔要」等空泛語句，甚至指手劃腳，來表達一切，表達能力遠遜內地小朋友。他解釋，本港小朋友說話詞彙少、組織差，與雙職父母欠溝通有關。\n他又提到，不少父母過分依賴語言學習光碟或外語學習應用程式來教導幼兒，忽略其本身吸收能力，誤信聽得多便識講，結果令小朋友未能吸收外語的同時，中文亦說得不好。\n另外，不少父母主張小朋友雙語學習，他曾遇過由外傭照顧的小朋友，搞不清中、英文用語，如飯碗以「bowl」表示，對「碗」這個中文字卻不認識，全因外傭說話雙語夾雜。\n梁認為，面對面溝通對小朋友幫助最大，因可及時糾正錯誤。不妨增加對答，嘗試問問他們的喜好、對環境的認知，讓小朋友思考問題，繼而表達意見。\n（撰文：蔡淑汶 攝影：陳智良）\n摘錄自香港經濟日報",

CIEL is an annual conference for researchers to report and discuss the latest progress in evolutionary linguistics.\nRooted in Darwinian theory, Evolutionary Linguistics references two evolutionary forces, biological and social, to explore two fundamental research areas, namely the emergence and development of language. From an interdisciplinary perspective, evolutionary linguistics interacts with anthropology, archeology, biology, linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. Collaborative empirical research among these areas will make new contributions to evolutionary linguistics, both in breadth and depth. Through CIEL, we wish to promote international interaction and boost interdisciplinary collaborations. Previous CIEL conferences in Guangzhou (2009), Tianjin (2010, 2015), Shanghai (2011, 2019), Beijing (2012), Hong Kong (2013), Xiamen (2014), Indiana USA (2016), Kunming (2017), Nanjing (2018), Lanzhou (2021), and Jinan (2022) were all held in the same spirit. Conference topics may include the following:\nLanguage as a complex adaptive system;\nLanguage and population evolution;\nDiachronic and synchronic study of language;\nDialect formation and evolution;\nArchaeological and fossil evidence of language evolution;\nVertical and horizontal transmission of language;\nLanguage and the brain;\nAnimal communication and human language;\nGenetics and language;\nOther language-related research.\nThe working languages of CIEL-14 are Mandarin and English.",

  "text": "Established in January 2019, our Research Centre for Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience (RCLCN) adopts psychological and brain-imaging techniques, such as Electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), to examine language-related issues in the brain.\nOur research is multi-disciplinary from an evolutionary perspective. RCLCN provides a research platform which adopts a multi-method/multi-variable approach to investigate language evolution/development and its interactions with different types of cognitive skills, including music. Alongside the pursuit of the intellectual interests, we aspire to devise methods to enhance the learning effectiveness of native and foreign languages, to expedite the clinical diagnosis of linguistic impairments, such as aphasia, dyslexia, and aging-related diseases, and to explore new directions in the treatment of speech-language pathology. Furthermore, RCLCN is also active in organizing relevant academic conferences, workshops, and summer schools.",

Wang, with Chinese subtitles)老齡化與認知：多學科研究的探討（王士元06252021演講視頻，附中文字幕）Presented at Intervention & Prevention of Neurodegenerative Disease: Building Resilience (ONLINE)中國大灣區神經退行性疾病的預防和干預(See also “Language & Cognition across the Lifespan,” the opening lecture video of RCLCN Summer School, by William S-Y. Wang)\nCognitive Decline and Language (CDL) is part of research at Research Centre for Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience (RCLCN). For the Centre, “The guiding light for our research is to consider the brain, cognition, and language on how the three interact with each other...” as pointed out in the above 2021 lecture video by William S-Y. Wang, “in Hong Kong, in China, we must remember that Chinese culture and Chinese languages are quite distinct from the context in which the WEIRD studies have been made; some may be in common if there are differences we ought to know what these differences are.\" (WEIRD, an acronym for \"Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic\", cultural identifier of psychology test subjects)\nNote: The screen is from William S-Y. Wang’s lecture in English along with other IPND lectures.\nAnd, \"Cognitive Decline and Language: Cumulative References\" is a full-text online bibliography and knowledge repository primarily to serve the community at large but also to serve colleagues in Mainland China by keeping updated with international literature. So the bibliography aims to be bilingual if possible with the contents such as the subject indexes and the glossary. The bibliographical contents include phenomena descriptions and explanations about cognitive aging and related neurodegenerative disorders/diseases. Investigation of their causes are explained in neuroscience which consists of multidisciplinary research methods. The roles of language during cognitive aging and neurodegenerative disorders are attentively explored. Control, prevention and interventions to cognitive aging in decline to neurodegenerative disorders are also pointed out in the contents of CDL bibliography. \nFull-text. The CDL online bibliography in full-text as a central part of CDL web is arranged as Bibliography A-M and Bibliography N-Z. \nCumulative References. The CDL bibliography in full-text is accompanied/referred by cumulative Abstracts, Indexes (by publication, by author, and by subject) and Glossary; they are compiled and recreated in hope for systematic overview overall of the selected CDL full-text literature. In addition, Database (CDL Reference Database), continuously updated and openly available to the general internet public, could assist to view each individual bibliography entry in details, with some collective-view functions such as by author/creator. As for Visualization, it is a brief visual presentation of CDL bibliographical data. And, Bibliometrics introduces the concept and software of data visualization analysis for finding research patterns and trend of specific topics. Cumulative References in progress can be accessed without password.\nAcknowledgement. This work is part of a research project at the Research Centre for Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience. Under the direction of William S-Y. Wang and Cho-Yee To (currently at the University of Michigan), it has been indexed and compiled by Yifeng Wu & Andrea Fung with needed help from university librarians, departmental technical colleagues, and CDL research team members.",

An online research seminar entitled \"Changing Time, Enduring Language, 時恆變 語常在\", The Speaker: Prof. HUANG Chu-ren (Chair Professor of Applied Chinese Language Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University)\nAbstract:\nThese unanswerable questions by Qu Yuan 屈原 were posed more than 2,200 years before Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle in physics and Quine’s indeterminacy of meaning in the philosophy of language. They share similar dilemmas of how to account for changes, such as the impossibility of tracking the movement of one single electron between two time points. In general, changes are captured by comparing two instantiations of the same entity at two different points in the space-time continuum. This leads to a methodological dilemma: a description of changes presupposes that two instantiations remain the same by presenting empirical evidence showing that they are not. In addition, a modeling dilemma arises from the hidden order (Holland 1995) of self-organizing complex systems, where neither the behavior of the whole system nor that of each individual component can be described in isolation.\nI propose in this talk that the foundation of conceptualization is the ability to commit to the enduring identity of an entity over a space-time continuum, in spite of observable differences. In addition, language as a system of knowledge representation is built both on the cognitive ability to assign time-dependent variations (i.e. changes) to the same entity (i.e. the ontological commitment of identity that endures changes), as well as the ability to flip time-dependency of linguistic units (e.g. denominal nouns, or deverbal verbs).\nThe fundamental cognitive tool of manipulating time-dependency that I propose can be instantiated as the foundational endurant/perdurant (i.e. continuant/occurrent) bifurcation of formal ontologies, or as the SNAP/SPAN perspective alternations in knowledge representation. Using this foundational concept, many challenging linguistic issues can be resolved, and a few instances of conventional wisdom underlying the theoretical foundations in linguistics can be updated for better explanatory power.",

  "text": "Mini Symposium on Teaching Chinese as a Second Language\nSpeakers:\nProf. CHANG Li-ping (Professor, National University of Taiwan)\nTitle: 語料驅動學習的華語實驗課程與成效分析\nAbstract:\n語料驅動學習（Data-Driven Learning, DDL）主張讓學習者從被動的知識接收者轉為主動的研究者，透過典型、大量且具語境的目標語輸入，驅動一個由下而上的學習過程（Johns, 1990）。鑑於DDL應用於華語課堂的實證研究極少，本研究設計了一個針對易混淆詞的教學實驗課程，以初步探知此種教學法之學習成效以及學習者對於DDL的態度或看法。招募五位不同母語背景的中、高級程度華語學習者，教授10組易混淆詞，課程總計5週，10個課時，前五個課時使用DDL間接教學法，後五個課時採用Sketch Engine平台進行DDL直接教學法。課程前，進行前測，課程結束後發放問卷、進行後測與訪談。就學習成效而言，後測通過率較前測平均提升了24%，本研究使用Wilcoxon檢驗其具有統計顯著性，顯示將DDL應用於易混淆詞的學習具有良好的成效。另外，透過問卷與訪談，得知學習者對此課程抱持正面態度，並偏好在教學者引導下觀察經過篩選過的語料，普遍喜歡以詞語搭配方法來學習詞彙。\nDr. JIANG, Song (Associate Professor, University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa)\nTitle: 基於夏威夷語言景觀的專題學習設計與執行：以夏大 STARTALK 與FALGSHIP 為例\nProject-Based Language Learning (PBLL) is a collaborative and communicative instructional approach in which language educators and community informants work alongside language learners to create meaningful learning opportunities with real-world applications. The Linguistic Landscape refers to the overall linguistic situation of a given region, encompassing all visual forms of language present in the public space of a geographic area. These linguistic forms serve as valuable historical and cultural resources for language teaching and learning. This presentation reports on a PBLL initiative based on the linguistic landscape of Hawai‘i, aimed at enhancing language proficiency, cultural awareness, and analytical skills within government-sponsored Chinese language training programs, namely STARTALK and FLAGSHIP. The presentation introduces the design and implementation of three PBLL projects developed for these programs: 1) Sun Yat-sen in Hawai‘i, 2) Honolulu Chinatown: Past and Present, and 3) Tour around Oahu. It examines the effectiveness of the methods and strategies employed in these projects and evaluates the learning outcomes in terms of building target language proficiency, cultural awareness, and critical thinking skills. The presentation argues that PBLL projects centered around the linguistic landscape in the community are effective in developing learners' professional language proficiency and facilitating their growth as they explore, analyze, and respond to similar texts and issues they may encounter in their future professional environments.\nDate: \n21 June 2023 (WED)\nVenue:\nFJ303, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong\nMode:\nHybrid (Face-to-Face Participation and Zoom)\nMedium:\nMandarin\nRegistration:\nhttps://forms.gle/vCdxQqBzjs5Jm5My8\n(FREE registration.

  "text": "Translation Studies in East Asia: Tradition, Transition and Transcendence\n11 - 12 Jun 2021\nThe home department of the Centre for Translation Studies, the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, is organising an international conference on translation studies. \nConference Statement\nHome to the cradle of various ancient civilizations, East Asia boasts remarkable and seemingly inscrutable traditions of language, culture and thought. Long histories of translational activities in the region have testified to the diffusion of knowledge, the quest for transcendental truth, the bond of identities, the vie for power as well as the rise and fall of empires, facilitating diverse and complex interaction of literate cultures. Yet rationalization on translation has long remained fragmented and disproportionate. Modernity witnessed the disruption of venerable traditions by western imperialism and the consequential transition of age-old institutions in search of new paradigms, prompting the intensification and valorization of translation initiatives and the resultant counter-interpellative translation discourse. With the contemporary professionalization of translation and development of translation studies as an integrated interdiscipline, researchers are addressing new issues and challenges, including cutting-edge advances in translation technology, and re-examining old concerns utilizing hybrid models and perspectives, hoping to extend the role of East Asia in the development of the field and to transcend their local, regional, global and spiritual existence.\nFor more details, please go to the official website for the conference: www.cbs.polyu.edu.hk/2019east/",

  "text": "治療內容簡介\n改善書寫能力是對「讀寫障礙」學生不可缺少的一部份。一般智力正常的學生在家透過進行適量的書寫練習，就可以應付學校對學生中文書寫的要求 (例如：默書)。可是，對於有特殊書寫障礙(Specific writing difficulties)的學生來說，雖然他們智力正常，但無論家長怎樣與他們反覆練習書寫，默書的成績總是強差人意，對家長以及學生本身造成相當大的困擾。\n書寫是一個複雜的過程。\n以默寫「橙汁的橙」字為例,我們在聽到「橙」這個聲音後,腦中要擷取和「橙」字音相對應的中央記憶(mental representation), 即「橙」字的字形、字音和字義。再將「橙」字的的中央記憶轉化成相應的書寫的動作和其動作,經計劃後，再指引不同的手部肌肉執行書寫的工序。\n書寫除了手部肌肉的協調,文字的中央記憶，亦涉及語音。部份有書寫困難的學童手部肌肉協調正常, 但未能有效地建立文字的中央記憶和動作記憶。他們寫的字工整,大小適中,但字型錯誤, 如把「橙」寫成「燈」。治療應針對他們的不足,建立文字的中央記憶和動作記憶。\n學生在單字層面出現書寫困難，其中一個原因是在於學生處理文字時所用的單位 (processing unit)過小所致。最近的研究發現,部件(logographeme)是書寫的基本單位。所有的中文字大約由三百多個部件所組成。學童如能有效地掌握部件的中央概念和動作記憶，可較有效地分析和存取文字，不需要死記硬背字型。\n本療程提供部件概念訓練，使學童對部件建立一個抽象的記憶，得以在文字運用的不同功能，包括在默寫，自由寫作和抄寫上都能得以充分發揮。書寫訓練療程AWA(Accelerating Writing Ability)目的是透過有系統地介紹100個經挑選過的部件，讓學生學習由運用筆劃的階段提升至利用部件的層面，使學童掌握書寫中文字的規則，提昇處理及書寫文字的效率。治療課以分組遊戲形式進行。每節均有家課給予學童回家溫習。當中更有「家長訓練課」，以解釋本療程背後的理念及回答家長的問題。\n課程特點\n充足的理論支持—書寫訓練療程根據梁文德博士研究的理論設計而成，訓練內容有充分的理據支持。\n科學化的評估—評估能篩選出特殊書寫障礙的學生，並透過分析可找出學生在治療前後書寫階段的對比。\n有系統的教材—全部教材均由全港小學教科書字庫挑選出來，全部部件會分三個階段由淺入深向學生介紹。\n療程形式\n言語治療師會為學生進行評估，篩選出有需要接受治療的學生。\n言語治療師再為家長提供訓練，讓家長能掌握AWA的理論以及與學生在家溫習的方法。\n之後治療會分為以下的形式進行—\n訓練課 (共十課) 溫習課 \n課堂主持\t言語治療師\t家長\t\n分組主持\t實習言語治療師/曾受訓的協助人員\t--\t\n流程\t部件介紹、小溫習、大溫習、課後評估\t家長利用適合的提示指導學生完成家課及重溫課堂遊戲\t\n次數\t每星期一次\t每星期兩次\t\n時間\t每次1小時45分\t每次0.5小時\t\n每課均有評估監察學生在運用目標部件的進度。\n每課均有家課提供，以幫助學生在家鞏固課堂上學過的知識。\n完成整個療程之後，言語治療師會為接受過治療的學生進行評估，與訓練前的結果比較。\n最後，言語治療師會按評估結果撰寫個別學生進步報告，以便家長了解學生的進展。\n訓練教材\n共十課的書寫療程會分為三個階段，詳細安排如下: \n評估\t課前評估: 每個個案均會進行三項標準化書寫測試，和一項標準化智能測試，以篩選出有需要接受治療的學生及建立訓練前基線。\t\n第一至 第十課\t階段 介紹的部件 形式 \n第一階段\t每課的十個部件均有讀音以及意思，有關資料能協助學生學習該目標部件，這階段的部件理論上是最易掌握的。\t以遊戲方式進行\t\n第二階段\t在每課的十個部件中，有讀音以及意思的部件的數量會減少，取而代之是沒有讀音但有意思的部件; 再加上沒有意思以及讀音的部件。\t\n第三階段\t在每課的十個部件中，全都是由沒有聲音以及意思的部件組成。\t\n評估\t課後評估: 完成療程之後，言語治療師會為每位學生進行有關中文書寫能力的測試，用作檢視學生在治療後的進度。\t\n每課訓練流程",

  "text": "治療內容簡介\n構詞法意識不足的學童較難掌握單字的意思，當學生不明白單字意思的時候，對他們學習新詞有很大的影響。一般小學生能利用已理解的單字去推斷詞語的意思，例如「石雕」就是用石造的雕刻的意思，但構詞法意識不足的學童即使理解「石頭」以及「雕刻」，都不能自動理解「石雕」是什麼，因為他們不明白「石」和「雕」分別就是「石頭」和「雕刻」的意思，加上學童亦不理解當中構詞所用到的規則，這導致學生不能有效地學習新詞，令學童詞彙不足。\n另外，構詞法意識不足令他們常常在認讀詞語出現困難，混淆在同一詞語其他單字的讀音，例如他們會將「清」讀成「潔」；將「聖」讀作「誕」，使學生學習中文有很大影響。\n構詞訓練療程(AMA)針對提昇學童的構詞法意識，目的是透過學習單字的意思，增加學童的詞彙、提昇學童學習新詞的能力以及減少混淆字詞讀音的機會，希望學童在課程後能更有效地學習中文。\n課程特點\n我們以認讀訓練療程的理論編制成治療課程幫助患有閱讀困難的學童，這些課程是由大學認可的言語治療師負責，課程的特點如下：\n(1) 充足理論的支持\n認讀訓練療程是由香港理工大學梁文德博士研究而成，理論與實踐並重，經過多次臨床研究証實完成治療課程的學童其構詞能力有明顯的進步。\n(2) 專業效果分析\n治療前評估 : 選出閱讀障礙的學生以及其閱讀能力程度，根據這些程度施以適當的訓練教材。\n每堂課後評估 :可反映學生在該課中閱讀能力的轉變，而治療師更藉此選取適合的教材作下一堂使用\n整體報告 :比較學生在療程前後在各方面的進步，治療師亦會按照結果給予評語和建議\n(3) 教材選取\n療程中所用的教材是根據每年更新的全港小學教科書字庫中選取，將中文字按不同的閱讀階段分類。言語治療師會因材施教，以個別學生的課後評估結果而調節下一堂的教材\n(4) 上課形式\n有閱讀困難的學童因面對處理中文字時常產生挫敗感，往往提不起勁去學習。本治療課程是以遊戲方式進行，富趣味性，令學童在過程中學習\n(5) 老師 / 家長講座\n本治療所可以安排講座，使家長或教師可以認識及了解有關認讀訓練療程背後的理念，和回答相關的問題。\n訓練內容\n1 課程內容\n認讀訓練療程共十六節課，詳細安排如下 ： \n第一課\n課前評估\n每個個案均會進行一項標準化閱讀測試，和一項智能篩選，為有需要接受治療的學生建立訓練前基線\n第二課\n至\n第十五課\n訓練第一階段\n(Productive free)\n通過介紹多產及自由 (productive free)的語素，讓學生明白單字有獨立的意思\n訓練第二及第三階段\n(Unproductive free; productive bound)\n通過介紹不多產但自由 (unproductive free)的語素和多產但黏著語素，希望令學生明白詞語其實是可以分拆的，而當中的單字有其獨立的意思\n訓練第四階段\n(unproductive bound)\n通過增加學生對不多產以及黏著的語素 (unproductive bound)刺激，令學生明白即使是黏著的語素，其實都擁有獨立的意思\n第十六課\n課後評估\n完成療程之後，言語治療師會為每位學生進行有關中文閱讀能力的測試，用作檢視學生在治療後的進度\n2 每課訓練流程\n服務形式\n本治療課程有多種不同的服務形式以配合個別及學校 / 機構的需要 ：\n1 診所治療\n形式 1 :\n個別治療 —\n經預約後家長可帶同學童到治療所由言語治療師進行評估，當完成評估後言語治療師會為該學童設計出一套適合他的療程再展開治療。在每堂訓練後言語治療師會向家長講解家課安排，家長更可藉著家中訓練幫助學童鞏固在課堂上未熟練的技巧。\n形式 2 :\n小組治療 —\n家長亦可為學童報名參加在本治療所定期舉辦的小組治療課程，這些課程是由言語治療師在評估後將程度相約的學童編成一班，之後以小組形式展開治療課程。我們亦在小組訓練時安排了一系列的家長訓練使他們也可以在家中幫助鞏固學童剛學過的閱讀技巧。\n2 校本治療\n形式 1 :\n直接治療服務 —\n言語治療師會定期到學校 / 機構直接向學生提供評估及治療服務，除學校 / 機構提供所需的訓練場地及最少一個工作平台作整理評估資料之用外，所有教材及協助人員均由言語治療師負責。\n形式 2 : 治療服務及協助成立支援團隊 —\n言語治療師先會為學校 / 機構組織及培訓一隊支援團隊，成員可以是老師及高年班同學。培訓內容包括怎樣預備教材及治療訓練實踐方法，之後治療師便會和支援團隊一同向有需要的學童展開治療訓練工作。此項形式的優點是支援團隊在過程中可學懂一些技巧，在日常的課堂中幫助到有閱讀困難的同學。",

  "text": "「媽咪帶我去渣（沙）灘玩！」、「老闆，我已經交交交……交了報告。」無論小朋友咬字不清，或上班族說話「口窒窒」，均影響個人發展及自信。有言語治療師表示，曾有僱員因口吃，險些兒飯碗不保；亦有父母亂說英語教壞細路，令小朋友有口難言，導致學習遲緩。\n梁文德指，言語治療師會以字卡測試兒童咬字發音是否正確，從而糾正。\n兒童讀寫障礙、成人表達能力差，以至老人中風後吞嚥困難，全部也是言語治療師的服務對象。在港孩愈養愈矜貴及人口老化下，言語治療師更為「吃香」，起薪點約2.4萬元。\n今年首辦言語治療碩士課程的香港理工大學，其中文及雙語學系副教授梁文德表示，曾遇到金融機構前線員工來求助，因他有口吃，打電話與客戶溝通，3分鐘的話用10分鐘也說不完；發不到E音，老闆英文名叫Ian，他永遠說不出，因而險掉飯碗。\n一星期改善口吃\n梁說：「他幾乎被炒才來求助，但花了一星期就把口吃問題改善。」要改善口吃並不困難，重點是學會控制口吃的方法，並努力鍛練技巧。不過，若患者想以後不再口吃，則需徹底改變說話模式。而朋友的支持很重要，若經常被取笑表達能力差，亦會影響其表現。\n不擅表達除了影響職場表現，亦會影響兒童學習能力。香港言語治療師協會主席區志漾指，曾有家長為使兒子學好英語，硬把英文作為家中唯一溝通語言，結果小朋友4歲多仍不懂說話，只懂透過手勢和表情表達一切，影響學習進度。經評估後，發現小朋友有語言遲緩問題。\n全英語可礙學習\n他認為，非所有幼兒適合雙語發展，家長亦要注意本身英語水平，亂說英語反會干擾子女學習。如個案中的小朋友，本身智力正常，但外語的學習環境反而為他帶來心理障礙。假如自小以中文溝通和學習，他未必需要花上一年半才追回同齡兒童的表達及學習能力，可謂得不償失。\n不少家長望子成龍，但區志漾提醒，除非小朋友本身語言學習能力很強，否則不建議家長盲目強迫子女雙語學習，並建議家長多與子女玩遊戲，如「狐狸先生幾多點？」、「煮飯仔」等，增加溝通機會。\n兒童有語言遲緩問題，很多時會發錯音，如「沙」會讀成「打、渣」、「狗」讀作「豆」、「書」讀作「豬」。香港社區言語治療中心言語治療師主管高展鵬指，透過玩肥皂泡，可鍛練幼兒口部肌肉多活動，增靈活性。另唱歌、字卡學習等，在言語治療師指導下，可助改善語言遲緩及讀寫障礙問題。\n百分百就業 循3途徑入行\n目前全港有約600名言語治療師，每年畢業人數僅40人，就業率達100%，起薪點約2.4萬元，可謂薪優出路佳。梁文德表示，內地缺相關專業人士，致近年從內地來港求助的個案急升，私營醫療機構甚至願意調薪1至2成「挖角」。\n言語治療師除了可在公私營醫院從事醫療工作外，也可在特殊學校或特殊兒童保健教育中心工作，又或在大學擔任相關研究人員。以醫管局為例，薪金介乎2.4萬至5.4萬元，13/14年度會再增聘4至5人。\n梁稱，本港未有言語治療師註冊制度，目前只由香港言語治療師協會確定有關資歷。取得資格途徑有三︰\n1. 於香港大學修畢言語及聽覺科學學士學位課程；\n2. 持有海外言語治療相關學位，並註冊成為該國言語治療師，執業資格亦可在香港獲承認。\n3. 理工大學今年首辦言語治療全日制碩士課程，修讀年期為兩年半，學費為36萬元，課程名額不超過40人。報讀者如曾修讀醫科等相關學科，或曾從事特殊兒童或老人護理工作，將獲優先考慮；學生須完成350至400小時督導實習。\n加強親子溝通 勝於一切\n科技日新月異，兒童玩具由毛公仔、積木變成平板電腦和智能手機，梁文德指，不少兒童日夜沉迷玩平板或手機遊戲，溝通能力每況愈下。\n現今有小朋友只會說「嗯」、「唔要」等空泛語句，甚至指手劃腳，來表達一切，表達能力遠遜內地小朋友。他解釋，本港小朋友說話詞彙少、組織差，與雙職父母欠溝通有關。\n他又提到，不少父母過分依賴語言學習光碟或外語學習應用程式來教導幼兒，忽略其本身吸收能力，誤信聽得多便識講，結果令小朋友未能吸收外語的同時，中文亦說得不好。\n另外，不少父母主張小朋友雙語學習，他曾遇過由外傭照顧的小朋友，搞不清中、英文用語，如飯碗以「bowl」表示，對「碗」這個中文字卻不認識，全因外傭說話雙語夾雜。\n梁認為，面對面溝通對小朋友幫助最大，因可及時糾正錯誤。不妨增加對答，嘗試問問他們的喜好、對環境的認知，讓小朋友思考問題，繼而表達意見。\n（撰文：蔡淑汶 攝影：陳智良）\n摘錄自香港經濟日報",
