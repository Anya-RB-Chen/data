  "text": "Non Credit Bearing Subject - CSRCE\nWriting Research Articles\nInformation for students\nCode: ENGL 6005 \nStatus: Non-credit bearing \nPrerequisite: None \nSemester: 1 and 2 \nHours: 39 seminar hours (3 hours per week for 13 weeks) \nMode of Assessment: 100% coursework\nObjectives\nThis subject aims to develop postgraduate research students' ability to plan, write and revise research articles related to their PhD/MPhil studies.\nWhy you should publish research articles\nAs a research student, your main objective is to write and defend your thesis and thereby obtain your PhD or MPhil degree. This subject will not only help you accomplish this objective, through its sharp focus on academic writing skills, but will also show you how to publish the findings of your research in key refereed journals in your field.\nThere are five very good reasons why you should publish research articles while you are studying for your PhD/MPhil:\nIf your department requires you to publish your work before submitting your thesis, you clearly have no choice but to develop the ability to plan, write and revise research articles. You will therefore find this subject extremely relevant and practical.\nIf you publish research articles in refereed journals before you graduate, you will be fulfilling one of the fundamental criteria that examiners consider when assessing research students' work, namely that it is of a publishable standard. If your thesis contains references to your own publications, you will already have gone a long way towards convincing your examiners that you are a professional researcher.\nIf you wish to pursue a career in the higher education sector after graduation, your chances of securing your first academic position will be greatly enhanced if you already have publications, particularly if they are in reputable international journals.\nIf you intend to enter the business or professional worlds, you will find that having a track record in research will impress prospective employers as it will not only indicate that you possess an in-depth understanding of your subject, but also the ability to communicate your ideas effectively in English.\nIf you write research articles during the course of your PhD/MPhil studies, you will be able to obtain valuable feedback on your work from editors and reviewers, which you can then use when writing your thesis. Writing research articles will also help you to sharpen your academic communication skills in English.\nSubject content\nThis subject focuses on the content, organisation and language of the key sections of a research article. The indicative syllabus is as follows:\nAnalysing research articles: generic structures, linguistic features.\nSelecting appropriate journals.\nPlanning research articles: title, headings, sub-headings.\nWriting effective introductions: introducing the problem/issue to be addressed, creating a research space, stating objectives.\nWriting critical, purposeful literature reviews: referencing conventions, summarising, paraphrasing, synthesising and critiquing sources.\nDescribing research methods: ‘clipped' and ‘elaborated' approaches, cohesion, citing standard methods.\nReporting and interpreting research findings: presenting quantitative and qualitative data.\nDiscussing the implications and significance of the findings: relating findings to the purpose and aims of the article and key references in the literature review.\nDrawing conclusions: summarising and evaluating the study, discussing limitations, making recommendations.\nWriting abstracts.\nRevising and proofreading an article before submission: grammar, vocabulary, style and tone, cohesion.\nAddressing editors' and reviewers' comments: redrafting and resubmitting the article.\nLearning outcomes\nAfter successfully completing the subject, you will be able to:\nidentify suitable specialist journals for your research articles.\nanalyse and apply generic structures and linguistic features in research writing.\nexercise critical judgement in relation to your own and others' work.\npresent and discuss your research findings in clear, accurate and appropriate English.\nprepare your articles for publication in light of comments from editors and reviewers.\nClassroom approach\nTeaching and learning will focus on analysing and discussing the content, organisation and language of research articles related to your field of study. You will then be encouraged to apply what you have learned when writing your own articles. The seminars will be highly interactive and you will be asked to share your own experiences and writing samples. These seminars will also be a very good opportunity to meet research students from other PolyU departments.\nTeacher\nThis subject will be taught by Dr Stephen Evans. Dr Evans is a highly qualified and experienced teacher and researcher. He holds bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Oxford and a PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Edinburgh . He has an excellent track record in publishing research articles in major international journals.\nAssessment\nThis is a non-credit bearing subject. However, you will receive a grade for the subject, which will be recorded on your PolyU transcript. Your grade will be determined by your performance in four written assignments (each worth 25%) which you will prepare outside class.\nIntroduction\nResearch methods\nFindings\nConclusion\nThese assignments will be directly related to your PhD/MPhil studies. You are encouraged to plan, write and revise a research article during the 13 weeks of the course (although this is not a requirement). If you adopt such an approach, you should be in a position to submit an article of a publishable standard to a relevant specialist journal by the end of the course. The four assignments should therefore be seen as key stages in the process of writing a research article.\nContact details\nIf you would like more information about this subject, please contact Ms Zoe Mak (egeeprs@polyu.edu.hk, AG428, 3400 3497) or the programme coordinator, Dr Victor Ho (victor.ho@polyu.edu.hk, AG411, 2766 7539)\nClick here to download the subject outline.\nAdvanced Oral Skills for Research Students\nCode: ENGL 6004 \nStatus: Non-credit bearing \nPrerequisite: None \nSemester: 1 and 2 \nHours: 39 seminar hours (3 hours per week for 13 weeks) \nMode of Assessment: 100% coursework\nCourse outline\nAims:\nIt is hoped that the subject will generally enhance students’ confidence in English speaking in an academic context.\nObjectives:\nTo help students overcome their difficulties with English pronunciation by concentrating both on common and individual pronunciation problems;\nTo help students appreciate the difference between spoken and written communication in English;\nTo enhance students’ ability to structure and deliver academic oral presentations in English;\nTo develop students’ ability to participate in seminars, workshops and other kinds of academic discussions.\nSyllabus Outline:\nIntroduction to the sounds of English, and those that cause the greatest problems for non-native speakers;\nWays to correct fossilized errors in speech;\nPronunciation\nThe differences between oral and written communication in English;\nStructuring and delivering oral presentations;\nParticipating in seminars, workshops and tutorials which require spoken English.\nLearning & Teaching Pattern\nTutorials\nThe whole class will meet every week for 1 hour\nWe will discuss from pronunciation to presentation\nWe will look at presentation skills and techniques\nSeminars\nHalf of the class meets every other week\nAll participants will give a 5 to 10 minute presentation on a topic of their choice\nEveryone will give constructive feedback to each other in order to improve their skills and build up confidence \nPolyU postgraduate research students are invited to submit to us parts of their written work for advice, from one of the EEPRS team members.\nWork submitted by students will first be read by us, then there will be a face-to-face, one-to-one session with the research student and the EEPRS team member. In the session, the students will be helped to develop their writing skills, through an increased awareness of their own writing strengths and weaknesses.\nWe recommend that students start taking advantage of this service at the beginning of their writing process so that areas needing improvement could be identified as early as possible.\nAs we do not provide a simple surface-correction proofreading service, requests to proofread chapters or the complete thesis will be declined.\nGeneral guidelines:\n- Dissertation Chapters / Students' Research Papers based on Dissertation\n- Each one-hour session covers around 10 pages*. You may book up to 6 sessions.\n- Font size: 12 points\n- Spacing: Double-line spacing\n* You can submit more than 10 pages each time, but with the possibility of having it divided into several sessions.\nHere are some comments from students who have been to EEPRS mentoring sessions:\n\"clearly provides alternative of words and suggests the ways to rewrite the sentences\"\n\"This service is very helpful to understand some viewpoints and requirements of the reader. It can improve the flow of my thesis. I will highly recommend this service to other students.\"\n\"wholeheartedly concerned by the mentor on my writing\"\n\"I found the mentor nice and helpful\"\n\"the discussion session is useful that provides a chance for me to discuss with the mentor\"\n\"gave me some useful general suggestion on how to express ideas clearly in thesis\"\nIf you are interested in booking a mentoring session, please click here.",

  "text": "In this new book published by Routledge, our Dr William Feng explores communication and society in contemporary China through systematic analysis of multimodal discourse at the national, institutional, and individual levels, as China experiences significant socio-political shifts and rapid development of new media.\nDr Feng systematically investigates and discusses the new discursive features in relation to relevant socio-cultural contexts. The analysis and discussion provide researchers with a social semiotic perspective on various aspects of communicative and social changes in contemporary China. The book also contributes to the growing field of multimodality by developing a set of cross-disciplinary analytical frameworks to deal with complex discourse forms in print media, moving images, and new media.\nThe research findings provide a unique Chinese perspective on a broad spectrum of issues such as discursive governance, nation branding, university marketization, and identity performance. The book is relevant not only to discourse analysis and multimodality, but also to other disciplines which will benefit from a systematic understanding of Chinese discourse, such as cultural studies, communication studies and area/China studies.\nMore information about the book can be found on the website HERE.",

  "text": "We are delighted to share the list of the recipients of the Outstanding Alumni Award 2023 of the Department of English and Communication. The Department would like to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of four of our alumni in their fields. The four awardees listed below have all made significant contributions to PolyU, our Department, and society.\nThe Alumni and Young Alumni awardees, in alphabetical order by family name, are:\n1. Ms Candice LAU Lok Ying, Communication Officer, UNICEF Sudan (Graduate of 2019)\nOutstanding Young Alumni Award in Community Service Achievement\nMs Candice LAU’s engagement with community service started when she was a student at PolyU, where she worked as a youth facilitator and programme assistant in several local NGOs. She joined UNICEF Vietnam after graduating in 2019 and was stationed in Hanoi as an Education Associate, where she worked to help ensure access to education for children. Her current role within UNICEF Sudan highlights her dedication to advocating for the rights of Sudanese children through her leadership in various campaigns. Ms Lau’s wholehearted devotion towards promoting the rights of various disadvantaged communities is truly commendable.\nMr Paul Lee, Chair of the Departmental Advisory Committee and a member of the Judging Panel, said, “The essence of communication is to bring people together to hopefully achieve some meaningful objectives together. Candice, being a proud graduate of our department, has set a good example of doing meaningful things outside HK (i.e., in Vietnam and Sudan), bridging various communities around the world so those in need can be served. This is a great example of communication well lived and interpreted for the betterment of mankind!”\n\"Receiving the Department’s Outstanding Award is an honour for me, especially given that young women are often less recognised for their contributions,” said Ms Lau. “I hope that this serves as a reminder that this award should celebrate diversity and challenge the definition of success, showing that the path to achievement is not limited to certain areas of work or demographics. This recognition has inspired me to continue my development and humanitarian work with the most vulnerable children, leading towards a more inclusive future\".\n2. Ms Doris LEUNG Shuk Yi, Co-Founder, Diamond Tech (Hong Kong) Limited, and Founder and CEO, Diamond Cab (Hong Kong) Limited (Graduate of 1993)\nOutstanding Alumni Award in Entrepreneurial Achievement\nMs Doris LEUNG is an award-winning and pioneering social entrepreneur and founder of Diamond Cab, the first wheelchair-accessible taxi service company in Hong Kong. Over the past 12 years, Ms Leung’s work has inspired the taxi industry within Hong Kong to recognise the need for and to allow increased access to barrier-free taxis. Currently, with over 100 wheelchair-accessible taxis of different brands operating throughout Hong Kong, Diamond Cab has set the benchmark of running quality taxi services with empathy. Ms Leung’s work has demonstrated how commercial business can be improved by adopting a social mission, especially with the untapped need for ageing care.\nProfessor Eric Friginal, Head of the Department and a member of the Judging Panel, said, “The innovative work of Ms Leung has contributed tremendously to supporting the social welfare and ageing care sectors, showcasing the potential for innovation and local ingenuity to bring about fundamental changes and policy shifts”.\nMs Leung expressed it is a great honour to receive the award, and said, \"I am grateful to have been empowered by the knowledge of Language and Communication at PolyU. I have practised what I have learnt to curate the social entrepreneurial journey of Diamond Cab with a long-lasting impact to make a better ageing world\".\n3. Dr Esterina NERVINO, Assistant Professor, Department of English and Department of Marketing, City University of Hong Kong (Graduate of 2018)\nOutstanding Young Alumni Award in Professional Achievement\nDr Esterina NERVINO joined the retail industry after she completed her PhD studies within the Department. Dr Nervino went back to academia in 2021 and has incorporated her professional network and experience into her curriculum to benefit students by allowing them to interact with international corporations through their university studies. Dr Nervino is well recognised within luxury retail for her great contributions within the industry towards raising awareness about the role of discourse, particularly in discussions surrounding sustainability as a crucial component of corporate commitments, efforts, and achievements.\nDr Amy Suen, Chairperson of the Department of English Alumni Association and a member of the Judging Panel, congratulated the success of Dr Nervino, “Your hard work, perseverance, and continuous pursuit of professionalism have led to excellence. By sharing your insights, you have inspired your fellow alumni to achieve their goals. Your invaluable perspective and positive mindset are truly an asset”.\nDr Nervino felt honoured to be the recipient of this award and said, “I would like to express my gratitude to the Judging Panel and the staff of the Department of English and Communication for their nomination and support during my studies. Thank you also to all the people who have contributed to this achievement. This recognition further motivates me to pursue a greater integration between linguistics and marketing in my research and to strengthen the collaboration between academia and the business sector, highlighting the key role that discourse plays in society”.\n4. Mr Phil WOO Pak Fai, Co-founder and Product Director, PREN (Graduate of 2008)\nOutstanding Young Alumni Award in Entrepreneurial Achievement\nMr Phil WOO showcased his entrepreneurial acumen as Co-founder and Product Director of PREN by developing proprietary hardware and software solutions for multinational corporations and start-ups, achieving impressive financial results. Mr Woo co-invented ground-breaking products, such as an anti-infection waterless mobile toilet for caretakers and a smart toilet lid to facilitate primary healthcare, which have secured HK$700K in grants from the Hong Kong Government via the PolyU Maker Fund and Cyberport Creative Micro Fund. Mr Woo’s innovative ventures have not only driven growth and success in their respective industries but have also left a lasting impact on society as a whole.\nDr Amy Suen said, “Your entrepreneurial achievements are shaped by your vision, determination, and hard work. We would also like to celebrate your positive disposition and the impact you have on others. Thank you for what you do. You are a shining example of an outstanding alumnus. Congratulations!”\nMr Woo shared his excitement about receiving this award, “I am honoured to be recognised among such talented and accomplished fellows in our Department. This award will motivate more of us to continue pushing the boundaries of exploration and pioneering”.\nWe would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations again to this year’s awardees for their outstanding contributions and achievements!",

  "text": "IRCAHC Events \nSeminars / Lectures / Workshops \nOrganiser\nDepartment of English and Communication\nSpeaker\nProf. Bernadette Watson\nRemarks\nThis event is jointly organised with the International Research Centre for the Advancement of Health Communication, PolyU.\nSummary\nPlease note the thematic talk is rescheduled for 21 April 2023.\nWe all need to communicate every day, but communication is critically important in healthcare settings, which are diverse and often complex. Why does communication really matter in healthcare, and why is communication failure so common? In this talk, I discuss the challenges of interprofessional and multidisciplinary communication where health professionals with different backgrounds must come together to work as a team to ensure good patient outcomes. What does it mean to be a good leader and communicator? How is the hospital setting different and what are the unique difficulties many health professionals encounter? Leaders who can communicate effectively can bring teams together, but those who can’t will cause fragmentation and conflict. Health professionals who aspire to management roles must understand that being both an excellent communicator and a role model for a team are skills. These skills can and ought to be learned. The topics I cover in this talk are linked to the new Master of Health Communication, which equips health professionals with these and other skills crucial to success as a health professional, and as a leader in health.\nKeynote Speaker\nProf. Bernadette Watson\nDepartment of English and Communication, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nView Speaker's Website\nBernadette Watson is a psychologist and Professor in the area of health communication. She is a Distinguished Member of the International Research Centre for the Advancement of Health Communication, which she directed until January, 2023, at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

  "text": "Organiser\nResearch Centre for Professional Communication in English, Department of English and Communication, PolyU and Department of English, CityU, in collaboration with Asian Pacific Region of Association for Business Communication\nSpeaker\nProf. Geert Jacobs\nCharles Lankester\nJacopo Pesavento\nProf. Franca Poppi\nProf. Lifei Wang\nDr Yunxia Zhu\nSummary\nThe Department of English of the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), and the Research Centre for Professional Communication in English (RCPCE), Department of English and Communication of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) present the first edition of their joint effort in fostering research in business and professional communication. \nDrawing upon the successful framework of the \"Talking English Across the World\" (TAW) Symposium which reached its 7th edition, this event extends its scope by joining forces for the first time with the Department of English of CityU for a 2-day conference preceded by a workshop aimed at bringing together academics, professionals, and institutions to promote a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary discussion, and to elicit dialogue about business and professional communication in Asia and the world. It is a CityU-PolyU joint conference in collaboration with Asian Pacific Region of Association for Business Communication. \nThis conference aims to stimulate discussions about professional communication practices in a changing world by highlighting the role of discourse in reflecting and constructing the changes. The changes can be the emergence of digital genres, the increasing attention to multimodality, crisis management during the pandemic, re-definition of the 'workplace' and globalisation with subsequent changes in leadership and management communication, as well as the shift of corporate discourse to focus on environmental, social, and governance themes (ESG). In response, the conference creates a platform to shed light on new rhetorics disseminated by businesses across sectors and markets, as a result of corporate peer pressure, increased activism and consumer engagement on social media, and growing risks for reputational damage and financial impacts on corporations.\nConference website: https://polyu.hk/ldUkG\nKeynote Speaker\nProf. Geert Jacobs\nProfessor, University of Ghent, Belgium\nGeert Jacobs is a Professor at the Linguistics Department of Ghent University. He is a former President of the Association for Business Communication and has published widely in the field of media and institutional discourse studies. \nCharles Lankester\nEVP Global Reputation & MD Hong Kong, Ruder Finn Asia\nCharles Lankester is a financial and corporate communications specialist and manages Ruder Finn’s Global Reputation Management Practice, based in Hong Kong.

In particular, she has been focusing on English as an international lingua franca, as it is used in written corporate communication and corporate web-sites as a common means of communication to address multiple and multicultural audiences. Paying attention to companies’ need to balance local cultural identity and global appeal, she has investigated sustainability issues in the aviation industry, exploring the proactivity of different airlines’ (Delta, JAL and Etihad) in the preservation of the environment, as documented in their CSR reports. Moreover, the interest towards sustainability issues has led to a new line of research, which tries to establish whether airlines’ environmental policies are actually informed by criteria of transparency rather than a mere embellishment of the company’s activities.\nShe is on the Advisory Board of the Profile Journal, Issues in Teachers’ Professional Development and is also a member of the review team of other international Journals, such as, for instance, the Asian ESP Journal and the Journal of Linguistics and Literature Studies. \nProf. Lifei Wang\nProfessor, Beijing Language and Culture University\nLifei Wang is professor at the School of Translation and Interpreting, Beijing Language and Culture University, China.

Our collective aim was to develop a transformative system of practice that breaks cycles of disadvantage and enables mothers impacted by incarceration, and their children, to have safe, dignified and fulfilling lives. In doing so, we sought to develop a comprehensive and shared understanding of mothers’ and children’s needs, examine current correctional and programmatic practices, identify system barriers and gaps in services across the sector (e.g., child protection, health, education), and allocate responsibility for change. This presentation will provide an overview of the principles and methodologies employed in this co-creation project, including those from implementation science and system design approaches. Key findings will be described, drawing from workshops with mothers in prison and government and non-government service providers, journey mapping and extensive consultation. Critical ingredients for success in employing the co-creation approach will be discussed and the transformative model for individual- and system-level change will be presented.",

  "text": "RCPCE Events \nSeminars / Lectures / Workshops \nOrganiser\nDepartment of English and Communication\nRemarks\nThis event is jointly organised with the Research Centre for Professional Communication in English, PolyU.\nSummary\nIn this presentation I will explore how sound memes are used in Tiktok as a resource for Shared Stories (Page, 2018). Tiktok is characterised by imitation culture (Darvin, 2022) where sound tracks form the basis of memes (Shifman, 2014) which circulate widely in the network. The intertextuality and multimodal resources of sound memes open up new avenues for the shared story, where words, music, image, dance, filters and editing effects can be used to narrate various kinds of experience and construct various kinds of in-group and out-group stances. Drawing on a range of examples, from narrative song lyrics, theme tunes from television series to instrumental sound effects, I will show how shared stories are reproduced and reworked in the context of Tiktok.",

  "text": "Is English just about literature? Is it simply a boring set of grammar rules?\nJoin us in this year’s PolyU Taster Programme to see how English is, in fact, closely related to our everyday lives. You will learn how to use English communication skills to solve real-world problems effectively in both local and global multilingual settings and discover that English can also be “applied” like science! \nWe have designed two practical and hands-on activities for you to examine how English is used in different situations:\n1. Understanding Miscommunication \nMisunderstanding and miscommunication in academic, professional, and workplace interactions are common occurrences, but they may at times lead to unexpected consequences. You will be introduced to real-world instances of communication breakdown, with the goal of identifying the primary reasons or causes of miscommunication and how to potentially avoid these to make future interactions more efficient. \n2. Smart living with language technology \nTechnology has penetrated every part of modern life. With smartphones, we get the latest information about shops nearby, we book tables at restaurants, we exchange messages and we enjoy immersive games with friends. At the Department of English and Communication, our teachers and students apply our linguistic knowledge to develop the next generation of language technologies. Our vocabulary-learning app IdiomsTube is now used by 9,500+ learners worldwide. Join this workshop to discover the fascinating work that we do behind the scenes to develop smart language technologies and to learn how you can be part of our team! \nThese activities will provide you with a brief glimpse into our BA (Hons) Scheme in English and Applied Linguistics (BAEAL) programme. You will also meet our student ambassador and get to know the wonderful study experiences in our programme!\nMode: Face-to-face\nMedium of instruction: English\nNo. of places: 50\nTarget participants: Secondary 4 and 5 students\nProgramme fee: $50 (Refundable deposit)",

In the QS rankings 2022, PolyU is ranked 66th in the world, 25th in Asia and 6th in the ‘Top 50 Under 50’ list of the world’s young universities. In the area of linguistics, the Faculty of Humanities – of which the English and Communication Department is a part – is ranked 51st in the world in the QS subject rankings. The medium of instruction and administration at PolyU is English, making it anespecially suitable setting for international students to undertake doctoral studies. \nThe Department of English and Communication\nWith ‘Linguistic Excellence in Professional Contexts’ as our mission, our research in the Department focuses on applied linguistics, sociolinguistics and professional communication. Thematically, our research covers major areas such as health communication, political communication, digital media communication, advertising and (city) branding, and language teaching and learning, as well as core areas in linguistics, including the study of language in society and discourse analysis. Much of our research is conducted under the auspices of our two internationally oriented research centres: \nThe Research Centre for Professional Communication in English \nThe International Research Centre for the Advancement of Healthcare Communication \nWe regularly host major international conferences and symposia as well as research seminars featuring leading scholars from around the world. The Department is therefore a very vibrant and congenial setting in which to study for a doctorate.\nHow to Apply \nYou should make your initial application to the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong through the Fellowship Scheme’s online system to obtain a reference number before submitting a full application. When you apply for admission to the PolyU, via the Fellowship Scheme, you will be considered concurrently for a regular place assigned to the University through the award of a Postgraduate Studentship.

Eligibility and amount vary across destination and duration. Students may apply for GEO Funding for International Exchange for financial support. \nExtra financial assistance from the Exchange Grant and Government Subsidy will also be allocated to students who experience financial difficulties. \nStudent may refer to GEO website here for details about options for financial aid.\nSuccessful candidates will receive an exchange nomination from the department. After accepting the nomination, you need to attend a briefing (around October, for semester two exchange) organized by the Global Engagement Office (GEO). At this briefing you will receive information about applying to your exchange host university and other follow-up procedures. \nBelow are procedures to follow after you have received a formal acceptance letter from your host university:\nEnsure your travel documents are valid for at least 6 months after the end of your exchange period. Renew it immediately if necessary. \nCheck out the procedures and documents required from the Consulate General and proceed with your visa application immediately upon receipt of your acceptance letter. \nNon-local students are advised to apply for their visas in Hong Kong instead of the Embassy / Consulate in their home country. This is to ensure immediate support from PolyU in case the Consulate requests any supplementary documents to justify the application. \nIf the Consulate requires a certificate of student status, please approach the Country Coordinator of the GEO at PolyU for assistance. \nStudents should get their financial proof ready by the time they apply for a visa. Students have a high possibility of being rejected by the Consulate if they are unable to demonstrate they have sufficient funds in their bank account. The financial proof has to be in English. It is not a monthly statement but a bank document with evidence of a balance equivalent to the minimum amount required by the host country. It is best to present a bank document with the student’s name as the account holder.\nYou should also ensure that your student visa will be able to cover your entire exchange period. \nStudents should be fully aware of the fact that they will be withdrawn from the exchange programme if they fail to obtain a valid visa. Students are unlikely to be offered a second chance for exchange in other semesters.\nUnderstand accommodation options offered by your host university. Apply as early as possible but do not pay for the accommodation until you have received the enrolment letter.\nMake your flight reservation as soon as your travel dates are confirmed but beware that, if possible, payment should only be made AFTER you have obtained your student visa.\nWhen you decide on your departure date to the host University, you should refer to its Academic Calendar and look for the start and end dates of the academic semester. Ensure your departure date will not clash with the exam period at PolyU. Arrive prior to the start of the semester, if necessary, to attend induction activities or pre-semester language subjects.\nYou will become familiar with the exchange funding that is applicable to you at the GEO briefing. You can apply for the funding by completing the online Application for Exchange Funding and Pre-departure Form received from GEO.\nPolyU has arranged a Group Travel Insurance for staff and students on official activities outside of Hong Kong, international student exchange inclusive. Certain countries / host university may require exchange students to purchase health insurance for the duration of exchange. Carefully check the health insurance requirements of your host university and country as they may vary. PolyU Group Travel Insurance may not fulfil their requirements and you may need to arrange an alternative form of health insurance. Please refer to the GEO website for more information.\nStudents are responsible for selecting relevant subjects for pre-approval by Dr Anne Schluter or Dr Gerald Stell (ENGL Student Exchange Officers). When consulting Dr Anne Schluter / Dr Gerald Stell about your subject selection, bring with you the subject syllabuses. Also, be sure to come to the meeting with information about the number of credit hours that the host university considers to be a full course load for exchange students. This information can be provided in the form of printed official correspondence with the host university or a printed page from the host university’s international office that shows this information. \nStudents need to observe the number of content and proficiency subjects as stipulated in Q7 of FAQs on the departmental student exchange website. Students should note the policy of credit transfer. Please allow yourself sufficient time to look for classes and discuss them with the student exchange officers. It is a good idea to begin this discussion with the student exchange officers in mid-October.\nForm AR41a (download here)\nA copy of all the pre-selected subjects’ syllabi \nA copy of the official information about the number of credits the host university considers to be a full course load for its exchange students. \nA copy of the Acceptance Letter from the host university (For Departmental Exchange Student Only) \nA copy of the student’s passport and visa (For Departmental Exchange Student Only)\nA copy of the student’s flight itinerary and airfare receipt (For Departmental Exchange Student Only) \nA copy of Insurance receipt (For Departmental Exchange Student Only) \nStudents who wish to obtain one of the Student Exchange Officers’ signatures on exchange-related documents, please submit the forms to Miss Christy Chan at AG428. \nStudents do NOT need to contact the Student Exchange Officer or BAESP Programme leader individually for approval.\nAfter you have arrived at the host university, if there is any change in the pre-approved subjects, you MUST immediately consult Dr Anne Schluter / Dr Gerald Stell for advice by email. Include, in your email, the list of subjects originally approved followed by the subjects you are considering adding/dropping after you arrival at the host institution, including the syllabi for each of the added subjects. Any subsequent change in subject selection MUST be approved by Dr Anne Schluter / Dr Gerald Stell; otherwise, you run the risk of not having your credits transferred upon your return. It is important to keep a copy of the approval email because presentation of the approval for subject change during exchange will be required upon return to Hong Kong. It is students’ responsibility to choose subjects and to seek subject approval from the Student Exchange Officers before and during exchange. Be sure to allow sufficient time for any subject approval that is sought while on exchange. The Department reserves the right not to recognise any subjects that have not been approved by the Student Exchange Officers.\nAfter you return to Hong Kong and receive the Official Transcript issued by your host university, you are required to submit online Form AR41c (Application for Credit Transfer) and upload the following documents as soon as possible: \nA copy of the Official Transcript issued by the host university \nUpdated subject syllabi as handed out to students during exchange \nThe approval email from Dr. Anne Schluter / Dr. Gerald Stell for subject changes (if any) \nAn email notification will be issued to you via PolyU email if your credit transfer application is successful. GEO will confirm with department your credit transfer status at the end of the following semester 1. If students fail to gain approved credit transfer, GEO will demand return of their exchange sponsorship. \nIn addition, please be aware that it is necessary for students to pass all of their courses while on exchange. Failure in any single course will result in the deduction of the number of credits to be transferred upon return. This rule applies equally to students who are enrolled in minors and those who are single-discipline ENGL students.\nPolicy of Credit Transfer for Exchange Students \nFor BAESP students taking the Single Discipline Major Pathway, a block transfer of a maximum of 15 credits obtained from a foreign university can be transferred back to the BAESP programme for non-compulsory, non-Level-4 subjects, on the conditions that you have passed the subjects and that you have obtained prior approval from the Department’s Student Exchange Officer. Since BAESP students need to complete at least 21 credits at Level 4, Senior Year students who go on exchange will be eligible to obtain a block transfer of a maximum of 6 credits for non-compulsory, non-level-4 subjects back to the BAESP programme, on the conditions that you have passed the subjects and obtained prior approval from the Department’s Student Exchange Officer. Student would be responsible for any delay of graduation. \nFor BAESP students taking the Major & Minor Pathway, please note that attending an overseas exchange programme while taking a minor programme at PolyU may only be possible if their chosen subjects at the host university can match the requirements of BAESP and their minor programme at PolyU. In most cases, a maximum of 6 credits obtained from a foreign university can be transferred back to the BAESP programme for non-compulsory, non-Level-4 subjects. Students may transfer up to 9 credits for fulfilling the requirement of a Minor programme at PolyU, observing each department’s internal regulations. Students should have sought subject pre-approval from the Student Exchange Officer of the Minor-offering department before departure. \nIn the case of granting of subject credit transfer of less than 15 credits upon return from exchange, students have to study additional subjects at PolyU in order to fulfill the graduation requirements for the Major & Minor Pathway. Alternatively, students may consider validating 15 credits for non-compulsory, non-Level-4 BAESP subjects, and change to (opt for) the Single Discipline Major Pathway.\nBlock credit transfer rather than subject-to-subject mapping is usually adopted for subjects transferred to the BAESP Major and Minor in European Studies. \"Block credit transfer\" means that the credits are earned through subjects related to the programme but not necessarily compatible to individual BAESP subjects, in order to help students to get enough credits for the degree. Granting a block credit transfer takes into consideration the relevance of the pre-approved subjects taken at the host university to the intended learning outcomes of the BAESP programme. \nTo be entitled for a 15-credit block transfer, normally 5 subjects should be taken. Out of the 5 subjects, a minimum of three should be content subjects. In the case of the host university allowing only 4 subjects, 3 out of 4 should be content subjects. Any number fewer than the pre-approved credit number will lead to a deduction of credits, on a basis of 3 credits per subject. It is entirely students’ responsibility to choose relevant subjects and keep the content/proficiency subject ratio in balance. \nStudents who go on exchange are expected to take the recommended workload set by the host university, observing the prerequisite of individual courses offered by the host university. \nThe medium of instruction of your chosen subjects must be English. An Exception applies to foreign language proficiency subjects. Students who wish to seek credit validation for a Japanese or Korean minor from the CBS Department upon return, should seek advice and pre-approval from the CBS Departmental Exchange Officer before departure.\nStudents will have to obtain at least a pass in all the subjects taken overseas in order to be granted credit transfer. All the subjects must have been formally assessed. Grades/marks obtained at the host university will not be counted towards your PolyU GPA.\nContent subjects refer to those introducing particular theoretical knowledge. They are different from proficiency subjects, which aim to improve language skills (speaking, listening, reading and / or writing). ‘English Semantics’, for example, is a content subject while ‘Intermediate Spanish’ is a proficiency subject.\nBAESP students need to complete at least 21 credits from Level-4 BAESP subjects, namely two core major subjects, the Capstone Project, and three Level-4 elective subjects, before graduation. In order to graduate on time, please take note of the semesters in which core and Level-4 BAESP subjects are offered.\nSelect, from the website of your host university, the subjects offered during your exchange period. The ENGL exchange website also has a subject list for your reference. When consulting Dr. Schluter / Dr. Stell about your subject selection, bring with you the subject syllabuses. Students need to observe the number of content and proficiency subjects as stipulated above. Please allow yourself sufficient time to design the plan. \nBefore leaving PolyU, fill in the Form AR41a, and submit it together with subject syllabus and other required documents to Miss Christy Chan at AG428. Students do NOT need to contact the Student Exchange Officer or BAESP Programme leader individually for approval. \nAfter you have arrived at the host university, if there is any change in the pre-approved subjects, you MUST immediately consult Dr. Anne Schluter / Dr. Gerald Stell for advice by email. Include, in your email, the list of subjects originally approved followed by the subjects add/dropped after you arrival at the host institution, including the syllabus for the added subjects. Any subsequent change in subject selection MUST be approved by Dr. Anne Schluter / Dr. Gerald Stell. It is important to keep a copy of the approval email because presentation of the approval for subject change during exchange will be required upon return to Hong Kong. It is students’ responsibility to choose subjects and to seek subject approval from the Student Exchange Officer before and during exchange. The Department reserves the right not to recognize any subjects that have not been approved by the Student Exchange Officer. \nGet your transcript from the host university after the semester. \nAfter you return to Hong Kong and receive the Official Transcript issued by your host university, you are required to submit online Form AR41c (Application for Credit Transfer) and upload the following documents as soon as possible:\na copy of the Official Transcript issued by the host university \nupdated subject syllabi as handed out to students during exchange \nthe approval email from Dr. Anne Schluter / Dr. Gerald Stell for subject changes (if any)\nYear Two BAESP students with a Sem 1 of Year 2 GPA above 2.7 are qualified to apply. The selection will be based on the accumulated GPA of Year One and Year Two, extra-curricular activities, and performance at a selection interview.\nBAESP students are recommended to go on exchange in semester 2 of Year 3 so that they do not miss the core subject ENGL3002 Research Methods for Language Studies, which is only open in semester 1. \nSince BAESP students under the 4-year curriculum have to finish the compulsory Level-4 BAESP subjects and the Capstone Project in Year 4 (Final Year), they are usually not allowed to go on exchange in their Final Year. Exceptions may be made for high-achieving students who would like to attend the Huddersfield or UNIMORE exchanges.\nYes, you can. The main requirement is that the summer exchange programme runs for at least six weeks to be eligible for credit transfer. Subject suitability shall be discussed with one of the Student Exchange Officers prior to departure. Otherwise, it might not be possible to transfer your credits to PolyU upon your return.\nStudents who wish to study in Spain or Japan must take one Spanish or Japanese subject in Sem 1 Year 3 and obtain at least a Pass. The offer will be withdrawn if a candidate fails the subject. \nStudents whose first language is not Korean and wish to take regular courses taught in Korean at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies are required to provide evidence of Korean language proficiency, which include a. Over the 3rd grade of TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean) or 350 of KLPT; b. Over the 3rd level certificate of HUFS Center for Korean Language & Culture; c. Official transcript proving you have earned at least 15 total credits from Korean Language related courses. Please refer here for the most updated details. \nStudent can find the language requirements for each University here. While content of the above link are correct at the time of compiling, for the latest and most accurate information please refer to websites / information provided by the partner institutions.\nThe application for departmental exchange closes between February and March each year. Details regarding application deadlines will be sent to students through PolyU email accounts. \nPlease refer to GEO for their exchange programme application deadline.\nPlease refer to the column titled 'Credit Transfer' above.\nContent subjects refer to those introducing particular theoretical knowledge. They are different from proficiency subjects, which aim to improve language skills (speaking, listening, reading and/or writing). ‘English Semantics’, for example, is a content subject while ‘Intermediate Spanish’ is a proficiency subject.\nGrades / marks obtained at the host university will not be counted towards your PolyU GPA. However, at least a pass in the subjects taken overseas is necessary in order to be granted credit transfer. All the subjects must have been formally assessed.\nNon-ENGL students can validate a maximum of 9 credits for either free electives or a minor programme in the Department of English and Communication. A block credit transfer system may be adopted for credit validation towards a minor in ENGL, while observing the limit of up to 9 credits. To be entitled for a block credit transfer, a minimum of two-thirds of the chosen subjects should be content subjects. For example, out of three subjects, two should be content subjects (see Q7 below about ‘content’ subjects).\nCredit validation may also be granted on a subject-to-subject basis; that is, students can validate up to 3 subjects (up to 9 credits) with reference to the ENGL curriculum, for non-compulsory, non-Level-4 subjects. \nPlease note that the medium of instruction of your chosen subjects must be English. Students need to contact the ENGL Student Exchange Officer to seek advice on the selection of subjects and to obtain subject endorsement before departure. It is entirely students’ responsibility to choose relevant subjects and keep the content/proficiency subject ratio in balance. The student will have to obtain at least a pass in the subjects taken overseas for credit validation.\nIf non-ENGL students have already sought approval for the subject(s) for credit transfer in their home department, the Department of English and Communication cannot double count subjects. Students need to decide from which department, their home department or Department of English and Communication, they are going to validate credits for the subjects taken at the host university.\nNon-ENGL students should seek advice from their Departmental Exchange Officer for other subjects relevant to their major pathway before going on exchange, observing each department’s own policy.\n\tResources\t\nFor application for departmental exchange programme\t\nApplication form\nFor prior approval of credit transfer before departure\tAR41a form\nFor application for credit transfer after return from exchange\tOnline AR41c form\nFor information about student exchange financial aid and summer exchange programmes\tGEO website\nApplication and Subjects for Inbound Exchange Students \nPlease refer to the Global Engagement Office here for details.",

  "text": "Communication is a dynamic process.\nAbby Yang\nWinner of the ENGL New Logo Design Competition\nAbby is a Year 2 student of the BA in Communication Design at the School of Design of PolyU. During the virtual prize presentation held on 6 July 2021, Abby further explained the meaning she wanted to convey through her design: “The curves formed by the letters ‘E’ and ‘C’ represent communication as a dynamic process that connects people together. The ball bouncing out from the middle bar represents a breakthrough made for excellence.” Abby also said that the logo reflects our Department’s role as an interdisciplinary department where knowledge converges and diverges.\nOur Associate Head, Professor Bernadette Watson, admires Abby's work and views it as having both creative and aesthetic appeal. When presenting the award virtually to Abby during the virtual prize presentation, Prof. Watson said she was impressed by how the logo visualises the meaning of communication.\nTo Abby, it was a challenge for her to manage school projects and assignments while preparing her entry for the competition. Despite this challenge, Abby said she enjoyed the learning process and viewed it as having been a very valuable experience. After she finishes her studies, Abby wants to be a brand designer. The Department wishes her a prosperous and successful career.\nThe Department’s new title will be effective from 1 September.",

  "text": "I study the discursive construction of social and political phenomenon from a critical discourse analytical perspective. My goal is to better understand how people in society use language in identity-construction and argumentation.\nMy most recent book, Discursive Illusions in Public Discourse: Theory and Practice, puts forwards a multi-perspective discourse analytical framework, that of Discourse of Illusion, which seeks to theorise and analyse how ideological arguments posed by competing groups are formed and spread in society for the purpose of achieving collective consent. As such, I have done extensive research on political discourse, particularly in terrorism and public square movements (part of this research features in my book).\nCurrently, I am the principal investigator of a project on Digital Professions that aims to explore identity-construction on YouTube. I am also a member of the Research Centre for Professional Communication in English (RCPCE) and member of the Editorial Advisory Board for World Englishes.\nI am particularly interested in research projects that focus on public discourses, especially those deriving from politics, new and traditional media, and engaging them from the perspective of critical discourse analysis.",

  "text": "As a sociolinguist, I envision communication as emergent from users’ needs in a given time and space. Setting-specific styles, genres, and registers help to shape the forms – both linguistic and extralinguistic – that communication assumes. If multiple languages serve important functions within highlighted domains, analysis of these functions provides insights into multilingual repertoires. Power relations, language policies, language attitudes, and their concomitant discourses interact at various scalar levels to inform the strategic and appropriate deployment of these repertoires. Rich sites for observing such dynamics include those that feature multilingualism as a result of migration, colonial legacy, and/or other forms of multi-ethnic contact. Case study analyses shine light on the inner-workings of these mechanisms in small-scale settings. \nMy research is based on data collected from each of these types of settings. Internal migration, Turkish-only language policies, and socio-political pressures influence the language practices and ideologies of the Kurdish restaurant workers in my Istanbul-based work. The legacy of these policies informs my study of Turkey-born Kurds in an external migration context: a Kurdish diaspora currently residing in Warabi/Kawaguchi, Japan.\nMigration and power relations also feature prominently in my other on-going projects. Highlighting Lusophone and Hispanophone employees’ development of accommodation abilities and multimodal communicative resources in English-dominant workplaces, one of these projects focuses on a migrant-run housecleaning company in New Jersey, USA. The dominance of English also represents an important theme within the post-colonial setting of Hong Kong, which is the site of two additional projects. One examines language proficiency, agency, and Filipina domestic workers’ discursive constructions of overseas workers as heroes. A second project focuses on trans-gender identities and social practices from a chronotopic perspective. \nFinally, a newly established Hong Kong-based project takes a deep dive into the affective and multimodal forms of communication that help partnerships emerge between acupuncture practitioners and their patients.",

  "text": "I have been exploring real-world recorded and transcribed texts (i.e., corpora) from domains such as outsourced customer service call centers, healthcare, tourism and hospitality, global aviation, international maritime industry, and talk in multi-cultural and multimodal workplaces. My theoretical and analytical framework emphasizes the identification of discursive practices across socio-cultural structures and task dimensions of talk in these domains, focusing especially upon speakers' understanding of role-relationships, discoursal goals and objectives, cultural and racial identities, and power dynamics at work. An iterative cycle which combines computational approaches to data extraction and a progression of stages (that also emphasizes qualitative and functional analyses) shows how the structure and meaning of professional cross-talk can be successfully described, interpreted, and explained using patterns and evidence from corpora. \nI argue for the important role of applied corpus linguistics as a methodological approach in language and social research in contributing linguistics-based explications of workplace discourse. Applied corpus linguistics is understood to include the use of corpus resources, techniques, and tools in order to, for example, examine patterning in public discourses so as to obtain novel understandings of how language is used and construed in specific contexts (Thompson & Friginal, 2020).",

  "text": "Research Overview\nMy research focuses on the analysis of various types of multimodal discourse, such as advertising, film, newspaper, social media, classroom teaching, and textbooks. The main theoretical approaches I adopt fall within the areas of systemic functional linguistics (SFL), critical discourse analysis, conceptual metaphor theory (CMT), and pragmatics. A main theoretical focus of my research has been to integrate SFL and CMT in describing visual metaphors and metonymies. My analysis of multimodal discourse is essentially social and critical. I consider multimodal discourses as social semiotic constructs which realize specific communicative purposes and social functions on the one hand, and reflect social values, culture, and ideology on the other. My recent research has two focuses. One is on social values, attitudes, culture and ideology in political, news, public service and textbook discourses. The other is on corporate communication and advertising in new media (social media and e-commerce). I am currently working on ‘multimodal Chinese discourse’, which analyses various forms of media discourse with the aim of understanding communication and society in contemporary China.\nEducation and Academic Qualifications\nPhD (National University of Singapore) \nAcademic and Professional Experiences\nJuly 2019 - present: Associate Professor, Department of English and Communication, PolyU\nJune 2016 - June 2019: Assistant Professor, Department of English, PolyU\nMarch 2013 - June 2016: Research Assistant Professor, Department of English, PolyU\nTeaching Areas\nAdvertising and visual art \nMultimodal discourse analysis \nNew media and communication\nResearch Interests\nMultimodal discourse analysis \nSystemic functional theory \nMedia and communication \nMultiliteracies and language teaching \nResearch Output\nFeng, D.

  "text": "Research Overview\nThe focus of my research is language variation in multilingual settings, with a specific emphasis on postcolonial settings. I pay specific attention to inter-group dynamics and their reflections in language ideologies, code-switching practices, and variation patterns in ‘non-native’ varieties. This leads me to examine the sociolinguistic factors behind the emergence of new varieties, such as in particular New Englishes. My main on-going projects revolve around English in Namibia, a Subsaharan African country where English has increasingly been acting as a bridge between different ethnolinguistic groups and has been developing distinctly local features in the process. I take both quantitative and qualitative approaches to variable linguistic features, such as mainly phonetic features, morphosyntactic features, and grammatical/conversational code-switching, elicited in both experimental and naturalistic settings. I situate Namibian English data in the broader perspective of local sociolinguistic dynamics that also affect how indigenous languages are spoken. Recent work includes an edited book on code-switching, sociophonetic articles on Namibian English, and ethnographic articles on Namibia’s language ideologies and youth languages. Previous work includes studies of language attitudes and variation in the Caribbean and South Africa, as well as socio-historical studies of creole formation.\nEducation and Academic Qualifications\nAggregation, Louvain-la-Neuve\nMaster in Linguistics, Paris IV Sorbonne\nDoctor in Linguistics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel\nProfessional Qualifications\nFull Teaching Qualification\nTeaching Areas\nLanguages in Contemporary Societies\nEnglish as a Global Lingua Franca\nFreshman Seminar in Language, Culture and Communication\nLanguage and Society in Europe\nLanguage and Conflict in the Contemporary World\nLanguages in a Globalising World\nExploring Language in Social Life\nResearch Interests\nLanguage variation \nIntergroup communication, intergroup processes \nWorld Englishes \nMultilingualism/language contact \nCreole languages \nResearch Output\nStell, G.

  "text": "Research Overview\nCurrently, I am engaged in research on second language teaching and learning. My research focuses on three main questions. First, I seek to understand what knowledge second language (L2) learners should be taught at different levels. I explore the rhetorical and linguistic features of different academic genres with corpus-based approaches. The second question is: What methods can be used to teach the knowledge to second language learners? A particular interest of mine is task-based second language teaching and learning, and I have conducted experimental and classroom-based studies on how teachers can effectively design and implement oral tasks to engage L2 learners in both face-to-face teaching and online teaching environments. The third question is: How can English language education prepare English as a second (foreign) language students to learn content matters in English? This topic relates to English-medium instruction (EMI) research, especially in Chinese contexts. In my EMI research, I aim to provide insights into the needs of EMI students and teachers and offer suggestions on how English language teachers can better prepare their students for EMI classes.\nEducation and Academic Qualifications\nDoctor of Philosophy in English Language Education, The University of Hong Kong\nMaster of Arts in Teaching English as a Foreign Language, Lancaster University\nAcademic and Professional Experiences\nAssistant Professor, Department of English and Communication, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2022.7-present)\nAssistant Professor, School of Education and Languages, Hong Kong Metropolitan University (2022.2-2022.7)\nResearch Assistant Professor, School of Education and Languages, Hong Kong Metropolitan University (2019.8-2022.1)\nLecturer, School of Foreign Languages, South China University of Technology (2017.9-2018.8)\nResearch Interests\nSecond language teaching and learning \nTask-based language teaching \nEnglish for academic purposes \nEnglish-medium instruction \nResearch Output\nXu, Y., & Qiu, X.

  "text": "My focus of interest is gestures, movements of the hands and arms co-occurring with speech, a modality used together with language to externalize the thought. I first became aware of gestures as a field of research when analyzing why non-proficient speakers could not successfully communicate with native speakers. Aside from the obvious lack of language proficiency, there was also an apparent lack of proficiency in nonverbal skills that hindered creating meaningful content and relevant pragmatic meaning. The ultimate aim of my research is to prove the link between thought speech and gesture. I believe that gestures help alleviate cognitive load in thinkers/speakers but also that they carry a significant portion of the pragmatic meaning of our utterances.\nIn the early stages of my studies, I was fortunate to be challenged by Prof. David McNeill, who is one of the founding fathers of research into gestures, leading to a joint publication in 2017. In this paper we discussed the meaning of the ‘Growth Point’, McNeill’s hypothesis explaining the gesture-speech-thought link. Currently, I am working with other gesture researchers in Prof. Gale Stam’s AILA Research Network “Gesture, Multimodality, and SLA”.",

  "text": "Organised by the Department of English and Communication (ENGL), the first-ever PolyU Undergraduate Conference on Applied Linguistics and Language Studies (PolyU-CALLS) was held on Saturday, 4 March 2023. The inaugural event, held on campus, was a resounding success, with over 100 students from PolyU and other universities in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area participating in the conference. PolyU-CALLS 2023 featured research presentations by undergraduate students as well as plenary speeches by ENGL faculty members Professor Dennis Tay and Dr Anne Schluter. In keeping with the conference’s focus on showcasing the work of ENGL undergraduate students, the conference was supported throughout the day by more than a dozen undergraduate student volunteers. \nPolyU-CALLS reflects ENGL’s increasing focus on undergraduate student research. \"We saw a need for an event that was tailored to students' research interests, especially those who are completing their Capstone or Final Year projects. We hope that the conference will inspire Applied Linguistics and Communication students in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to get involved in language-based research more actively and spearhead their own original research studies,\" said Professor Eric Friginal, Head of ENGL at PolyU.\nThe breadth of topics and diversity of presenters at PolyU-CALLS 2023 brought in an audience that included faculty, postgraduate students, and undergraduate students. Attendees at the conference were able to listen to 32 different undergraduate presentations spanning subject areas that included language and social media; linguistic landscape and urban spaces; next generation workplaces; and language and European studies. Student presenters were competitively selected based on their submitted proposals or via nomination by their home departments. \nThe organisers of PolyU-CALLS 2023 were thrilled with the level of engagement and energy at the event. A post-conference survey was sent to all participants to help the Department know what can be done to make next year’s iteration of the conference even better. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with respondents praising the content and organisation of the conference (and the catering and gift bags provided for all conference attendees). The majority of respondents said they would recommend PolyU-CALLS to friends and classmates, with one attendee saying “Great event, hope to have another chance to join that again in the future, even though I am not a presenter. Thank you!”. Praise for the event also came from presenters, who appreciated receiving “a lot of valuable suggestions for research”.\nThough all student presenters at PolyU-CALLS 2023 did an amazing job, ENGL would like to recognise those outstanding presenters whose work went above and beyond at demonstrating research excellence. After evaluating both abstract submissions and the presentations themselves, ENGL would like to announce the following PolyU-CALLS 2023 award winners:\nBest PolyU-CALLS presentation: Ashima Shukla from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nBest ENGL presentation: Nok Lam Wong from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nBest non-ENGL presentation: Sum Wai Li from Hong Kong Baptist University\nThe level of student participation at PolyU-CALLS 2023 highlights an appetite for more student-oriented conferences in Applied Linguistics and Language Studies. “It’s amazing to see the level of enthusiasm present at the PolyU-CALLS 2023. We're delighted with how the event turned out,” said Dr Max Diaz, ENGL Undergraduate Programme Leader. “It's exciting to see students getting exposure to new research topics, receiving feedback on their studies, and experiencing an authentic academic conference. We're already planning next year's conference and hope to make it bigger and better.” With its first chapter coming to a successful close, students and the Department of English and Communication are already looking forward to PolyU-CALLS 2024.",

Under this programme, renowned scholars are invited to work with Alcalá’s researchers to explore new topics and develop international co-operations.\nThis residency will also serve to strengthen existing cooperation. Dr Lopez has been working on with scholars and students at the Department of Philology, Communication and Documentation of the University of Alcalá for a few years now. With their help, she has led a project studying the benefits of online learning of Spanish as a foreign language when the input is presented in different modalities (video, audio or text). A second project, still ongoing, evaluates the benefits of online teaching when the teacher's grammatical explanations are presented with or without gestures. Among the new co-operations Dr Lopez will explore is a study on the affective elements of the foreign language teaching and learning process.\nDr Lopez will also be giving talks to students and staff at Alcalá as well as exploring the opportunities for further collaborations and possible exchanges between the University of Alcalá and PolyU.\nThe first University of Alcalá was founded in 1499, becoming one of Spain’s most prestigious universities during the 16th and 17th centuries. It was moved to Madrid, and renamed Madrid Complutense University, reopening a campus in Alcalá in 1975 that eventually became an independent public university. Today, Alcalá has about 28,000 students a year and just over 2,000 teachers on two campuses. Among their degrees, they offer English studies and Modern Languages and Translation.",

  "text": "Research\nTitle of thesis\nAccent and Social Evaluation: A Sociolinguistic Analysis of Language Attitudes, Stereotypes and Listener Bias in University Settings in Nigeria\nDescription of thesis research\nIt has been established that every (speech) community has an accent. A lot of people interact with individuals who speak different accents other than their own. The Guardian (2020) has found that students at some of the leading universities in the United Kingdom are being ridiculed over their accents and backgrounds. O’Sullivan (2020) in his report titled, “You were hot until you opened your mouth: Accent bias in dating” highlights how individuals are discriminated against because of the way they speak. This discrimination portends some psychological dangers. Harrison Jones of the Metro News reported how a third-year doctoral candidate of Kent University, Jessica Small, committed suicide because she was mocked for not being “posh enough”. More so, Levon, Sharma, Watt and Perry (2020) observe that non-standard working-class accents are downgraded by British people and that one’s accents can influence the level of success a candidate will attain during job interviews. Many people are aware of accent discrimination in university settings; but neither linguists, students nor lecturers have a clear understanding of how students discriminate against lecturers who speak with Hausa English, Igbo English and Yoruba English accents.\nThe research questions for this study are: \nTo explore the degree to which attitudes to Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba ‘cultures’ relate to Hausa English (HE), Igbo English (IE) and Yoruba English (YE) accent attitudes among participants;\nTo evaluate if negative attitudes towards teachers’ accent have any impact on students’ understanding of the subject matter; \nTo explore the influence of gender on students’ attitudes towards HE, IE and YE accents;\nTo evaluate the educational implications of language attitudes in Nigeria.\nThis study appears to be the first project to investigate this recurrent issue in university settings in Nigeria by carrying out an interconnected set of empirical studies grounded in sociolinguistics and speech science.",

  "text": "Research\nTitle of Thesis\nFraming Unity, Democracy, Corruption, and Economy: A Corpus-Assisted Analysis of Metaphors in Nigerian Political Discourse (1970-2022)\nResearch Description\nWith regards to metaphor and political discourse, the Global North has always and dominantly informed the Global South with universalized findings. However, my research will take a look from the Afrocentric South at the metaphorical framing of four political-economic issues: (national) unity; democracy; corruption; and the economy. The study takes into consideration the source domains used in framing these issues in the speeches of Nigerian political leaders from 1970–2022 and how the source domains vary across time and by system of government (in this case, the military and civilian governments). Moreover, the speech corpora under study are delivered in Nigerian English (NE). NE is a variety of the World Englishes spoken in Nigeria. Following this, the study hypothesizes, among other things, that the metaphorical framing of the political-economic issues in Nigerian political discourse may follow different systematic patterns because metaphors are culture-specific and there should be variances, for instance, between the native English culture, the Hong Kong culture, and the Nigerian culture. Finally, the methodology of the study will offer a standardised nonintuitive procedure for metaphor identification, source domain verification, and analysis of metaphor change overtime following innovative approaches such as Steen et al.

  "text": "Title of thesis\nThe Representation of Jerry John Rawlings in the Ghanaian Media\nThis study examines how the Ghanaian news media represented Jerry John Rawlings, Ghana’s longest serving leader who transitioned from being head of a revolutionary military government (1981-1992] to become the first President [1993-2001] in the elected liberal democratic government in Ghana’s 4th Republic.\nDrawing on a corpus-assisted discourse studies approach and insights from discourse-historical analysis, the study explores the ways in which the media represented Rawlings, the variation in the representation during his military and democratic rule, and the legitimation strategies employed to validate these representations.\nSituated in a context underexplored in the literature, this study will contribute to knowledge on the ways in which the media represents individual socio-political actors in their performance of politics. By comparing the representation of Rawlings between the state-owned and privately-owned press, the study will enrich understanding of the implicit and explicit nuances embedded in the representational strategies of the media. \nIt will also shed light on the legitimation strategies, discourse and social practices embedded in the media’s presentation of Rawlings in the news which may reveal the ideological leanings of the media and how this may have contributed to certain public perceptions of him.\nThe following questions inform the research:\nHow was Rawlings represented in the Ghanaian news media during his military rule?\nHow was Rawlings represented in the Ghanaian news media during his democratic rule?\nHow did the state-owned press and privately-owned press represent Rawlings?\nWhich legitimation strategies were used in the Ghanaian news media to validate the various representations of Rawlings?\nResearch Group Affiliation\nMember Research Centre for Professional Communication in English (RCPCE)",

They are closely linked to speech and mind, and can offer valuable insights into the processes of L2 acquisition, like L1 transfer, processing difficulties, and interlanguage.\nConceptualization of time in mind can be expressed by tense and aspect, and by gesture as well through converting abstract conceptualizations of time into concrete spatial movements. The gestures that express temporality and occur simultaneously with oral temporal devices are “Temporal Gestures''.\nPrevious research into L2 tense and aspect acquisition has mainly focused on verbal modality and neglected the nonverbal gesture modality. The study looks into the acquisition of L2 English tense and aspect through the lens of gesture. Combining both qualitative and quantitative, offline and online research methods and techniques from sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and language education, the study discovers: 1) the roles of pedagogical gesture in teaching and learning L2 English tense and aspect; 2) the online processing of L2 English tense and aspect as reflected in sensitivity to and inhibitory control of temporal gesture-speech incongruencies; 3) the acquisitional trajectory of temporal gesturing as a developing system in its own right.\nPublications\nQu, C.

My thesis serves two main purposes: The first purpose of this study is to design a new conceptual framework for evaluating existing Business English curricula to a) determine what competencies are already being addressed, and b) design a teaching intervention that includes adjustments, additions, and supplementations that will better prepare learners for modern, transcultural communication. The second purpose is to test the theoretical utility of the framework in cultivating desirable linguacultural competence by executing a pedagogical intervention to enhance such competence. A mixed methods intervention design, anchored in a true experiment, will be adopted to collect qualitative and quantitative data from two groups: a control group receiving instruction on the existing curriculum and an experimental group that is exposed to the linguacultural teaching intervention in addition to the existing curriculum. I will determine the impact and perception of the intervention and then extract principles that can be applied to other curricula. The results of this inquiry will provide insight into how to develop Business English curricula to best prepare learners for modern, professional, transcultural communication. \nProfessional Affiliations\nMember of the TESOL International Association www.tesol.org\nMember of IATEFL and the Business English Special Interest Group (SIG)\nMember of Asia TEFL\nMember of the LSPPC: the Asia-Pacific LSP & Professional Communication Association\nOrganizing member of \"Conversations about BELF\"\nWritten Publications \nPeltonen, L.

  "text": "A Cross-disciplinary Corpus-based Study of Shell Noun use in English Academic Writing by Chinese EFL learners and native English speakers\nAbstraction, often manifested in such linguistic features as nominalisation and noun phrases, is considered especially characteristic of academic prose (Biber, 2006) Academic writing has been a major challenge for English for foreign language (EFL) learners because of its prevalence of abstract nouns, among which the concept of shell noun has received considerable attention. The term shell noun (SN) refers to those unspecific general nouns whose semantic meaning is complemented by a more detailed stretch of information in their immediate context. A prototypical example can be found in such sentence: They were worried about the problem that it might rain tomorrow. Interest in SN phenomenon generally centres on various inherent properties of SNs, ranging from semantic categorisation (Liu & Deng, 2017), lexical cohesion (Aktas & Cortes, 2008; Gray, 2010; Gray & Cortes, 2011), to stance construction (Charles, 2003, 2007; Jiang & Hyland, 2015). Few have extended the scope of research to the collocability of the SN and SN pattern attraction. In other words, few have paid attention to the tendency of a SN to co-occurs with a specific syntactic pattern. My study seeks to investigate the L1 Chinese and L1 English variation in the use of SNs in doctoral theses across three disciplines. In particular, the study is intended to examine, through quantitative analysis, Chinese EFL learners’ preferred SN-SN pattern co-selections as compared to native speakers of English across the three disciplines. The quantitative observation will be then supplemented with an in-depth qualitative investigation of the commonly-used SNs and the SN pattern in context. It is hoped that the research project will contribute to the understanding of how SNs and SN patterns are used by Chinese EFL learners, hence offering insight into the instruction of SNs in academic discourse.",

This study will combine an experimental design and discourse analysis. As a result, the findings of this study would provide evidence to support recent researches about how stressor-related emotional expression can be beneficial for people under stress. More importantly, the results of this study may offer an innovative way for counsellors to create a culturally shared language with students who struggle to communicate their intangible emotions. As such, it may help to promote effective communication between counsellors and clients and improve therapeutic outcomes. ",

I am particularly interested in conducting qualitative investigations of informal/recreational language learning practices, including language learning in the digital wild, and online language teachers’ creation of teaching materials on social media platforms. My other research interest lies in intercultural communication in digital contexts, in particular, the multimodal construction of identities and/or interculturality. Broadly speaking, my work strives to develop an understanding of translanguaging and multimodality in digital communication contexts.\nMy other research interests include multilingualism, digital multimodal composing, linguistic/semiotic landscape, digital literacies, and ethical issues related to digital research.",

  "text": "My research has mainly focused on language teacher education and English for academic purposes. \nIn my research, I have focused on promoting reflection among language teachers and devising models that extend this area of research. The current focus of my work is on teachers’ identity (re)construction and emotional vulnerability as a structural condition of teaching. \nAlso, inspired by my own journey of acquiring the rules and regulations of the academic discourse communities and the struggles and hurdles that I faced along the way, I have conducted research on academic literacy development and academic integrity in higher education. I am particularly interested in exploring the challenges, strategies, and life stories of newcomers or novice researchers on their path to gaining membership in their academic discourse communities. I have a special interest in improving scholarly communication by helping students gain the academic literacies they need to navigate within academic communities and stay away from bad science.",

  "text": "My research is broadly situated within the areas of second language acquisition (SLA) and second language instruction. I have a particular interest in the cognitive processes that underlie second language development. My research is empirical and has investigated topics such as the effects of second language practice, intentional vs. incidental learning, the development of implicit and explicit knowledge, task-based language teaching, and methodological issues related to research in these areas. \nThe primary focus of my research agenda has been related to spacing effects, and testing the degree that spacing and similar principles and concepts from the field of cognitive psychology generalize to authentic teaching and learning contexts and, in particular, to SLA. Recently, I have become interested in how second language instruction might be effectively differentiated, including for learners with specific learning difficulties. \nDoctoral Supervision \nI would be particularly interested in PhD supervision related to investigating distributed practice effects (spacing effects) in learning. Such projects could be aimed at investigating the learning of grammar or vocabulary under various spacing conditions, and the role of various mediating / moderating variables, such as working memory capacity, in this process. Other possibilities include researching the effects of spacing on other under-researched areas. There are a wide range of possibilities. Reach out by email to discuss.",

  "text": "Seminars / Lectures / Workshops \nDepartment of English and Communication\nSpeaker\nDr John Scott Daly\nFactual welfare television has been described as stigmatising and individualising—representing its participants as failures in a meritocratic society. This paper, however, revisits the 2014 British documentary Benefits Street and argues that it tends to humanise its cast, showing them as trapped in two social structures of benefits (i.e., the social security system) and street (i.e., the deprived local community). Using a multimodal critical discourse studies approach, the paper analyses the verbal, visual and sound tracks of the most popular episode to explore how these modes combine to portray the structure of benefits as stultifying, and the street as a restrictive community. These structures are selectively foregrounded at the expense of the wider, arguably more impactful structures of neoliberal austerity and welfare reform that characterised the political economy of Britain in 2014. The residents’ troubles, therefore, appear to be grounded in the two restrictive structures of benefits and street, and individualistic post-welfarism—surely implicated in their problems—becomes the solution.",

But if your level is higher than that of the group, then no. It would be unfair to the group and to you, as you will be bored and waste your time doing something you are already good at.\nBesides, language courses are quite expensive, so why not take advantage of learning a higher level? \nNo, you can’t. The STARS course is only an introductory course and you will soon be doing new things in Elementary I. Do not skip the first weeks as new content will be covered during these as well.\nFor Elementary I, no.\nFor other levels, yes, if you have not studied the previous level with us. Placement tests will run virtually during the first week of the semester. Please feel free to contact Dr. Renia Lopez via renia.lopez@polyu.edu.hk for more details.\nIf you are an ENGL student or a student of the Minor in European Studies, maybe yes (we will need to check every case). You will need to have studied at a higher level institution recognised by PolyU (for example, if you studied a language while you were on exchange), and the number of taught hours you had should be around 39.\nContact Dr. Anne Schluter, Exchange Officer, anne.schluter@polyu.edu.hk, for any matters regarding credit transfer if you are an ENGL or European Studies Minor.\nStudents from some faculties have this problem. Don’t worry, join the class for the first two weeks and then register during the add/drop period. Please contact the relevant teacher for each subject. Talk to your teacher the first week and explain your situation. This is very important because if the subject is over-subscribed we might not be able to do much, so your teacher will make a note of your name. If after the add/drop period you still cannot register we will help you do it manually.\nCheck out availability for another group.\nIf all groups are full, don’t worry, please contact the relevant teacher for each subject to join the class for the first two weeks and then register during the add/drop period when additional spaces will become available. \nTalk to your teacher the first week and explain your situation. This is very important because if the subject is over-subscribed we might not be able to do much, so your teacher will make a note of your name. If after the add/drop period you still cannot register we will help you do it manually.\nIn the past, we have been able to open extra groups if there were enough students. But you need to tell us, otherwise we don’t know what the ‘oversubscription’ total is. Talk to your teacher.\nSee if there is another group you can join. Contact the language teacher and explain the situation. If you can join another group then we will change you manually. If all groups clash with core subjects then join the first week of class and talk to the teacher (sometimes we can change the time of lessons, if the group is small, or open a new group, if it is very large). Please contact the relevant teacher for each subject .\nWe follow the levels set by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2. Click here for more information. Germany, France and Spain’s Language Institutions have all developed curricula and exams based on the requirements set by the CEFR. We follow these.\nThe level A1 is covered in about 80 hours (two semesters), and the level A2 in another 80 hours or so. After finishing a level A1 you are capable of finding your way around, talk about yourself, your family, your city. After finishing a level A2 you can have a (simple) conversation. To study a content subject in the foreign language you are required a B2 level and a C2 is as close to native as you can get.\nNo, we do not issue certificates. If you are interested in taking the official exam of the Goethe Institut (Germany), Alliance Française (France) or Instituto Cervantes (Spain), let your teacher know. Every year we have a number of students taking these tests, so your teacher will be able to help you prepare for it and also let you know what level to go for.\nGreat, that is the best way to improve your language abilities. Depending on your department you might have access to exchange programmes in these countries. The university also has exchange programmes there. Take advantage of these opportunities and start learning the language before you go abroad. Your department should take into account the fact that you have been studying the language.\nCAPS also offers WIE in some of these countries. Keep an eye on their calls.\nSome of the European Consulates offer prizes (money) to the best language students which you can use to study and travel abroad. Your teachers will tell you about these.\nStudents requiring more information are welcome to contact:",

  "text": "Prof. Geert Jacobs\nProfessor, University of Ghent, Belgium\nLeadership, personal branding and podcast: a discourse perspective\nIn this talk I draw on a mix of multimodal discourse analysis, linguistic ethnography and critical management theory to investigate how entrepreneurial podcasting has opened up new opportunities for leadership communication. In particular, I set out to demonstrate that today’s audio boom constitutes a unique site for exploring how entrepreneurs are negotiating the affordances of the rapidly changing digital mediascape for personal branding and for communicating their visions on what it takes to be successful in business. \nBio\nGeert Jacobs is a Professor at the Linguistics Department of Ghent University. He is a former President of the Association for Business Communication and has published widely in the field of media and institutional discourse studies.\nCharles Lankester\nEVP Global Reputation & MD Hong Kong, Ruder Finn Asia\nDoes Reputation Matter Anymore? Post-Credit Suisse, Pre-AI and Social Outrage Generally, Is It Important What People Think and Say About You in 2023?\nIn this talk, I focus on the tectonic shifts taking place in business and politics to investigate if reputation still matters in 2023. Banks are disappearing over a weekend but we still keep our money in banks. Presidents and Prime Ministers are being accused of breaking the law and seeing their popularity increase. Fashion brands are seeing global social media crises but seeing all-time highs in their share price. Consumer goods companies are accused of using forced labour but we still love their products. So what does it take to permanently reputationally damage a business, brand or person? What is unrecoverable? In my talk I chart three emerging themes in reputation and risk management and three priorities for organisations and individuals looking ahead in building their communication.\nBio\nCharles Lankester is a financial and corporate communications specialist and manages Ruder Finn’s Global Reputation Management Practice, based in Hong Kong. Charles has built a career in reputation management, investor relations and corporate communications and has worked in China, Singapore, South Korea and Europe. He brings experience, quick thinking and a focus on results to all client engagements. He understands today's complex communications and business environment and ensures his clients prevail and win. He has advised clients including L’Oréal, Rosewood Hotel Group, Citigroup, Heineken, Prudential and Marriott International on a range of challenging, business-critical communications assignments. These have included government relations, media relations, transactions and risk/reputation management work. He has also advised the Governments of Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Charles and the Ruder Finn team have been pioneering in the risk/crisis management space, working on complex, high profile cases involving product recalls, high-profile litigation, management change and share price fluctuation.

Brands looking to leave their mark in this market must rise to the challenge and embrace the cultural nuances that matter most to Chinese consumers. Gone are the days of one-size-fits-all marketing strategies - today's Chinese consumers demand more. They want brands that not only understand their values but also embody them. To truly connect with Chinese consumers, brands must go above and beyond in their efforts to understand and respect Chinese culture. From mastering the art of digital marketing to delivering exceptional customer service, every aspect of a brand's presence in China must reflect its commitment to making a positive contribution to society and culture. But don't just take our word for it. As China's economy continues to grow, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning, demanding nothing but the best from the brands they choose to support. By embracing these behaviors and adopting a proactive approach to localization, which goes beyond language translation and recognizes the orchestration of colours, images, sound and other communication elements as key in to establish messaging able to create a lasting bond with Chinese consumers and stand out in a crowded marketplace.\nBio\nJacopo launched Branding Records in 2013 with a mission of connecting with brands from east to west to define powerful, purpose-driven marketing strategies that put them on the leading edge of their industries. As the firm’s vision-holder, he provides big-picture oversight and advises clients on how they can leverage creative branding to maximize their growth. He is currently focused on expanding Branding Record’s reach into Europe and the Middle East as the next step in creating a truly game-changing global branding agency.\nAn expert in branding and a long-time veteran of the European and Asian markets, he has worked with many iconic, ground-breaking brands, including Salvatore Ferragamo, Ralph Lauren, Coca Cola Company, emerging fintech ventures, and more. On top of his 20+ years of on-the-ground experience, he also has expertise in defining and interpreting sociobehavioral and market trends. He lectures at several universities in Hong Kong and is a frequent speaker at entrepreneurial conferences.\nProf. Franca Poppi\nProfessor, Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Italy\nCommunicating corporate sustainability performance: A linguistic analysis across cultures and genres\nEver since the 1987 Brundtland Report introduced the concept of “sustainable development” and defined it as a development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, considerations about the protection of the environment have been increasingly taking centre stage in corporate boardrooms across the world. This, in turn, has led to a boom in \"corporate sustainability\" reporting options, as organizations have come to realise the importance of improving their communication activities, in response to rising public awareness about the impact of their performance. In fact, a growing number of citizens believe that modern enterprises have responsibilities to society that extend beyond their social obligations to their stakeholders. The obligation to investors is obviously to generate profits for the owners and maximize the long-term wealth of shareholders, but other obligations exist towards consumers, employees, the community at large, and the natural environment.\nThe aviation industry has long been labelled as one of the most polluting industries in the world. Then, in the early 2000s companies started to provide records for their carbon emissions in response to the growing awareness of the damages of climate change (Bansal and Kistruck 2006). Subsequently, data began to be released to demonstrate the effective environmental impact of each company, as the disclosure of positive trends related to carbon emissions had turned out to be advantageous in order to gain the audience’s approval (Vaccaro & Patiño Echeverri, 2010).\nStarting from the assumption that when communicating their corporate sustainability performance companies face a rapidly evolving and complex set of choices, this presentation relies on discourse-analytical and corpus linguistics tools to examine the language choices adopted across cultures and genres by a selected set of airlines.\nIn particular, the first part of the presentation will look at the CSR reports of three airlines with a different cultural background, Delta, Etihad and JAL focusing on the key words and their collocations, with a view to shedding light on the impact of local culture on environmental policies.\nThe second part of the presentation will investigate sustainability reports, with the aim of establishing whether or not Neos’s and Ryanair’s environmental policies are informed by criteria of transparency which can contribute to strengthening their relationship with stakeholders (Ball, 2009; Piotrowski, 2009).\nReferences\nBall, C.

Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press.\nBio\nFranca Poppi is Full Professor of English Linguistics and Translation at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, where she is also the Director of the University Language Centre. After studying the interactional features of discourse, with particular reference to academic settings (economics and marketing textbooks) and the language of the law, she moved her research interests towards intercultural communication. In particular, she has been focusing on English as an international lingua franca, as it is used in written corporate communication and corporate web-sites as a common means of communication to address multiple and multicultural audiences. Paying attention to companies’ need to balance local cultural identity and global appeal, she has investigated sustainability issues in the aviation industry, exploring the proactivity of different airlines’ (Delta, JAL and Etihad) in the preservation of the environment, as documented in their CSR reports. Moreover, the interest towards sustainability issues has led to a new line of research, which tries to establish whether airlines’ environmental policies are actually informed by criteria of transparency rather than a mere embellishment of the company’s activities.\nShe is on the Advisory Board of the Profile Journal, Issues in Teachers’ Professional Development and is also a member of the review team of other international Journals, such as, for instance, the Asian ESP Journal and the Journal of Linguistics and Literature Studies.\nProf. Lifei Wang\nProfessor, Beijing Language and Culture University, China\nConceptualizing and Measuring Language Management Maturity of Chinese Enterprises\nThis presentation describes the concept and theoretical framework of language management which includes six components of language planning management, language education management, corporate language management, language resources management, language standardization management and emergency language management. Based on this framework, a three-dimensional operational model of corporate language management maturity with an index system of 20 indicators are developed and validated to measure and rank quantitatively the language management maturity of 50 sampled Chinese MNEs in the B&R regions.\nThe study has yielded the following findings: (1) out of the 50 sample MNEs, 3 companies of Huawei, Alibaba and Bank of China ranked high in LM maturity, followed by 43 companies of intermediate LM and 4 of low level. (2) Industry analysis found that communications and internet industry has higher LM maturity index score (3.59), than manufacturing, finance, transportation and international trade. (3) The LM maturity index for private enterprises is higher than big SOEs. (4) The maturity index of LM planning is highest than the LM environment and LM implementation. (5) Regression analysis shows LM maturity has impact on the corporate performance. Enterprises of higher LM maturity have better financial performance. The study has important implications for the improvement of corporate language management of Chinese companies.\nLifei Wang is professor at the School of Translation and Interpreting, Beijing Language and Culture University, China. He also leads the Academy of Language Services (the National Base for Language Service Export, approved by MOC, China). His academic interests include applied linguistics, language in international business, economics of language, language services studies, translation markets, etc. He is Co-Chairman of the China Forum on Language Services 40, and president of Business English Committee, China Shipper’s. \nDr Yunxia Zhu\nAssociate Professor, University of Queensland, Australia\nVice President of Asian Pacific Region of Association for Business Communication\nIntercultural Communication Competence for Global Managers in Uncertain Times: An Activity-based Theory Perspective \nIntercultural communication competence is often viewed as a structured-based model composed of cognitive, behavioural and affective dimensions, which is widely applied in business communication for global managers training and learning in the past few decades. However, this model may not be sufficient for today’s global contexts filled with uncertainties and crisis. Two significant research gaps exist with this model including (1) the focus on structure rather than process of communication; (2) the tendency of stressing cultural differences as barriers rather than as resources. Hence we need an extended more positive process-based model that incorporates relevant knowledge and skills for dealing with uncertainties and challenges.\nSpecifically, I introduce an activity-based framework in light of the social and cultural tradition developed by Vygotsky using language and artefacts as a tool of learning. This theory was further developed later by Engeström and applied to the organisational context stressing expansive learning. According to Engeström, expansive learning involves the creation of new knowledge and new practices for a newly emerging activity. In other words, learning is embedded in and constitutive of qualitative transformation of the entire activity system. Expansive learning is thus useful for creatively extending the horizon of intercultural competence in boundary crossing and network building across communities and cultures, which is essential during times of uncertainties and crisis. Therefore, I combine the activity-theory framework with intercultural communication competence model in three aspects in expanding performance, synergy and global mindset. I use linguistic tools (e.g., Hymes ethnography of communication, cultural pragmatics, etc.) to develop the following three aspects followed by specific cases to illustrate this model of intercultural communication competence for today’s very complex global contexts.\nActivity is used as a major unit of analysis across all the cognitive, behavioural, and affective dimensions with consistent underlying interests of communities and their well-beings. This is to develop an activity system for achieving goals in communication and practice.\nSynergy can be achieved through expanded networks across communities of different cultures. Here I view culture and language as a tool for drawing resources into the communication process through a deeper understanding of self and the other.\nGlobal mindset can be expanded creatively in communication of managing uncertainties drawing strengths from all parties involved for specific activities. In doing this in all dimensions of intercultural communication competence, a new activity-based culture emerges for positive and proactive communication about tasks, performance, and activities as part of the entire activity system for global managers. This system draws strengths from all stakeholders of a wide range of cultures, turns uncertainties into expansive learning opportunities across cultural boundaries.\nAssociate Professor Yunxia Zhu is an award-winning researcher and educator and has an international reputation in cross-cultural management and communication. Her research focuses on cross-cultural management, discourse studies, knowledge management and learning, and business ethics (e.g., Confucian ethics).\nShe enjoys an international reputation, have published two scholarly books, more than 60 journal papers including prestigious international journals (e.g., ABDC A and A* journals in both international business and communication), as well as a series of book chapters. As a result, she has won a number of research and education awards. She is the winner of an Australian National Teaching Citation Awards, Association for Business Communication Distinguished Researcher Award and Best Publication Award, UQ Vice Chancellor's Internationalisation award, and so on. She often serves as keynote speaker at international conferences and conventions.\nShe is Vice President of Asian Pacific Region of Association for Business Communication, a member of Executive Committee as well as Board of Directors. She serves as Associate Editor for the International Journal of Business Communication-Association’s business communication journal.

Communication failures and breakdowns in team functions have been associated with medical errors. Simulation is a standard instructional strategy in health science education. Interprofessional simulation learning experiences are increasingly common with a focus on enhancing communication and collaboration. The School of Nursing from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University has developed a learning module of interprofessional clinical training and education through simulation to promote students’ transfer of team-based learning into their clinical experience. It included online theoretical input and simulated laboratory sessions. Colleagues and students from the Department of Rehabilitation and the Department of Applied Social Sciences were invited to participate in this project. \nThis study showed that students benefited from this interprofessional simulated clinical learning in addition to their theoretical understanding. Given the increasing need for team-based collaboration to address the complex needs of patients conditions, more interprofessional simulated learning modules included clinical placement should be arranged for students in their future clinical practice. \nKeynote Speaker\nMs. Ivy Wong\nSchool of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nMs. Ivy Wong is the Clinical Associate of the School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).

It is an inclusive community where the professors are approachable and extremely friendly. My studies centred around English linguistics and communication, which helped me to realise my interests in languages and pursue further study in Linguistics.\nAmy XU\nAwardee of Outstanding Student, Faculty of Humanities 2015\nPolyU Student Sharing: The Most Outstanding PolyU Student 2017\nAmy Chan, graduate of 2018 from our BA programme and The Most Outstanding PolyU Student in 2017, shared how the programme has prepared herself to be a professional communicator and talked about her initiative to serve society upon graduation.\nAmy has an outstanding academic performance and proactively participated in extra-curricular activities during her university life. In the video, she explained her interest in and deep passion for language. The internship experience in the CLP Limited Group Public Affairs department has allowed her to apply the professional knowledge she learnt from our BA programme.\nAs a co-founder of an education-related enterprise DoEd (渡一), Amy is determined to work together with her friends to trigger the potentials of Hong Kong secondary students by equipping them with life skills through experiential learning opportunities. \nInternational Student Sharing: Study our BA programme at HK PolyU\nMaciej Nowakowski, a graduate from Poland in our BA programme, developed his interests in foreign relations and journalism with the knowledge and training received from our programme as well as engaging in the culturally diverse student life in PolyU. \nMaciej highlighted that studying in PolyU offers opportunities for students to go beyond the understanding of Asian and European culture both academically and socially like writing a paper on English-Turkish translation and sharing personal experience at cultural events.\nAlumni Sharing \n“What I value most from this programme is the training of a critical thinking mindset. A wide range of courses from gender issues and media analysis to sociolinguistics and business English has sharpened my big picture skills and enabled me to challenge hidden assumptions. These transferable skills are vital to my current role in an international management consulting company, where I distil and digest a lot of information while translating complex ideas into digital strategies and business cases.\nBeyond lectures, international exposure is a major highlight of my university life. I joined an internship programme in Australia, arranged by the Department, and represented PolyU in debate tournaments in Germany and Korea and conferences in Singapore and Shanghai. These out-of-classroom experiences have inspired me to think about cultural diversity and what it means to be a truly global citizen in addition to developing my intercultural communicative competence. More than just a nurturing ground for careers, the diverse opportunities in PolyU have equipped me with the capability for lifelong learning that every leader of tomorrow embraces.”\nVivian LEUNG\nChevening Scholar & Former TEDx\nProgramme\nManager\nGraduate of 2014\nPhoenix LAM\nAssociate Professor, Department of English and Communication\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nGraduate of 2003 (BA) & 2008 (PhD)\n“I re-joined the Department of English and Communication, my alma mater, in the summer of 2016 as an assistant professor, after having worked at Hong Kong Baptist University and the Open University of Hong Kong. It was at the Department of English and Communication where I obtained my bachelor’s degree and doctorate. It was also at the Department where I enjoyed one of the happiest periods of my life as a student. Since my undergraduate years, I have been impressed by the outstanding quality of the academic staff, both in terms of teaching and research. As a student, I never had the experience of failing to access a book or a journal article from the library, either physically or online. I was also fortunate enough to have received scholarships for my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, both of which were first-class education experience comparable to one from any other top university in the world. The collaboration between the Department and institutions worldwide allowed me to participate in overseas study programmes in the UK and in Sweden. I would not have had so many excellent opportunities for academic and personal development had it not been because of the Department. For that I am forever grateful.”",

  "text": "MAEP is not just about English grammar and business writing. It is more about developing strategic thinking. As a senior manager within a renowned multinational organisation, effective English skill is the key to communicate with customers, suppliers, colleagues, and superiors, who operate from many different parts of the globe. Understanding cultural differences, deploying the appropriate tone and manner makes the difference between winning and losing valuable business contracts and relationships. I strongly recommend MAEP to everyone, in any stage of their professional career, who aspires to achieve a higher level in English, the lingua franca of business.\nConnie Lee\nGeneral Manager, Suntory Beverage and Food HK, Brand Suntory HK\nGraduate of 2014, MA in English for the Professions\nThe programme has allowed me to enter into a new discipline which covers all the key subjects and essential knowledge that lay a solid foundation for the further study and prepare students well for their future career. It is structured in a practical and systematic way so that students can learn effectively over the course of one year. I have also learned many practical analytical skills through different workshops and activities. I have noticed that linguistics researchers are often needed in other disciplines so I have come to realize how useful the program is and what a huge advantage it has brought to me. The teachers are very supportive and always give us useful advice. We could reach them for help easily whenever needed. What I have learnt and gained from the programme far exceeds what I have expected.\nZhang Wenxin\nProject Associate, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nGraduate of 2013, MA in English Language Studies\nDoing my MA degree at the Department of English and Communication, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University was really an eye-opening, rewarding, and transformative experience. The teachers here typically adopt a student-centred approach combining varied teaching methods, including interactive lectures, case studies, group work, and online discussion. During the lecture, students are encouraged to raise questions and share their ideas. The professional and academic achievements I attained at PolyU have helped me to excel myself in different jobs ranging from teaching at a language centre to working as an administrator at a university in Hong Kong. The lifelong learning experience I gained at PolyU has motivated me to embark on my academic journey again to pursue a PhD degree here at PolyU after years of working.\nYating Yu\nPostdoctoral Fellow, Department of English and Communication, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nGraduate of 2013, MA in English Language Arts\nCompleting my MA in English Language Teaching at the Department of English and Communication at PolyU has been a tremendously rewarding experience in many ways. Not only did the programme offer a range of highly relevant and interesting courses which equipped me with the necessary skills and knowledge vital to my career in teaching EAP/ESP, but through attending the courses I also met some of the leading scholars in the field who provided expert knowledge and guidance. Beyond studying, another invaluable aspect of the MA is that you will get to meet lots of different and interesting classmates with whom you will establish lasting bonds. I would recommend the MA without any hesitation to anyone who seeks to advance their skills and knowledge in any of the four specialisms offered by the degree programme.\nWilliam Lee (PhD)\nLecturer, Center for Language Education, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\nGraduate of 2012, MA in English Language Teaching",

  "text": "Although international communication between pilots and air traffic control (ATC) is conducted in a restricted language with significant constraints imposed by two-way radio, some deviations from standard phraseology are tolerated and even expected in certain situations. One question is how much deviation is necessary and whether some deviations could be not only tolerated, but included in the phraseology. For instance politeness markers such as 'good day' or 'thank you' are considered useful in general conversations because they help smooth interactions and create better relations between speakers. That could also be the case in aviation communication. These phrases, however, increase the length of the speech signal, thereby decreasing intelligibility. I will present the results of an analysis of transmissions between pilots and ATC at four international airports (Sydney, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Hong Kong). Our study investigated correlations between the occurrence of politeness markers and communication errors, and correlations between the occurrence of politeness markers and factors known to affect the success of communication, such as speech rate, information density, and language alignment. The results confirmed previous research results (Dissanayaka, Molesworth, & Estival, 2022) and anecdotal reports of greater non-standard phraseology and faster ATC speech rate at Los Angeles, compared with airports outside the USA. The study also provides empirical data for aviation language training for native and non-native English pilots and ATCs on using politeness markers. \nDissanayaka, Y., Molesworth, B. R.

  "text": "Hong Kong secondary schools have undergone dramatic changes over the last 4 years mostly due to the social unrest, the extended lockdowns during covid and the revision of the secondary school curriculum. The government school sector has seen the departure of over 7,000 teachers, two thirds of whom were experienced secondary school teachers. This has created not only educational management and leadership vacuums, but also an unusually high staff turnover and influx of the number of new teachers, many of whom are fresh graduates and do not yet have PGDEs. These changes come on top of the normal challenges in MOI English secondary schools where the decentralised curriculum puts demands on syllabus, materials and assessment development on the classroom teachers. The EDB continues to respond to these changes with professional development in the form of a mixture of school-based support programmes and short training events targeting EMI schools.\nThis seminar will offer some unique insights, informed by visits to over 30 schools and multiple classrooms, about some of the key challenges being experienced in the secondary school sector with specific reference to the delivery of good quality Language Across the Curriculum (LAC) practices in subjects MOI English classrooms.\nThe Department of English and Communication has been awarded over 20 EDB projects in the last 8 years and the project team (Dr Jane Lockwood and Mr Peter Woodhead) will present a candid account of the successes and on-going challenges of MOI English teaching in this sector and a picture of what it is like in 2023 for subject teachers at the front line.",

  "text": "Events \nProfessor Catherine Nickerson\nResearch into business discourse has been ongoing since the beginning of the century and we now know a considerable amount of information about how business people around the world use \"talk or writing in commercial organizations in order to get their work done\" (Bargiela-Chiappini et al. 2013; p.3). This research has allowed us to identify many of the skills that students of business (English) in higher education settings will need once they enter the workforce. As Nickerson (2022) notes, however, much still remains to be done in finding ways in which we can help students to practice and develop these skills in a relevant way in the classroom, most especially if we consider the changes that have taken place in workplace communication more generally as a result of the COVID pandemic. In this presentation, I will discuss how the effective online teaching of a business English course can also provide students who have little or no work experience, with a means of developing the digital communication skills they will eventually need for the workplace. In doing so, I will discuss the different sets of digital skills that scholars have identified as crucial for professional business people if they are to succeed as communicators, and I will also show how developing these skills can be incorporated into an online business English course.\nProfessor Catherine Nickerson\nZayed University, United Arab Emirates\nView Speaker's Website\nCatherine Nickerson is a Professor in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Zayed University in the United Arab Emirates.

As a result, the test is an ineffective agent for promoting the status of the Zhuang language in the ways intended by its designers and policymakers.\nMore information of the article can be found on the website HERE.",

  "text": "Events \nProfessor Richard Fitzgerald\nOn 13th March 2021, a vigil for Sarah Everard who was abducted and killed by a serving police office in the UK on March 3rd 2021 was to be organised at 6 pm at Clapham Common bandstand by a local activist group, Reclaim These Streets (RTS). However, after the police declared the vigil unlawful and refused to facilitate the assembly under the then-current Covid-19 lockdown rules, the group called off the event. Despite this well over a thousand mourners came to the scheduled location and gathered around a central bandstand where individuals each took the bandstand delivering speeches to the gathered crowd and leading to a controversial nationally televised stand-off between the crowd and the Police. This presentation extends Harvey Sacks’ concept of omni-relevance to explore the way participants actively managed their potential membership of the device 'organised and its constitutive category 'leader' through discursive and embodied actions. The analysis examines how speakers oriented to three participant categories, the crowd, police, and journalists, and the physical structure of the bandstand to speak as a member of the crowd, while not being seen or heard as speaking on behalf of the crowd by the police or journalists. Our analysis shows how the participants were oriented to resisting or forestalling this device as an OR device, as one that was always potentially relevant and when invoked, when seen to be operative, would have priority.\nProfessor Richard Fitzgerald\nUniversity of Macau, Macau\nView Speaker's Website\nRichard Fitzgerald is Professor of Communication at the University of Macau.

  "text": "Events \nProfessor Parvaneh Tavakoli\nThe increasing interest in examining the construct of oral fluency in the field of second language acquisition is primarily attributed to the crucial role fluency plays in successful communication. From a research perspective, fluency is also important as it helps researchers understand how L2 speech is produced and what factors promote or inhibit the speech production process. From a professional practice perspective, fluency attracts attention since it is considered as the ultimate goal of language learning for many L2 learners and is typically examined as one of the key aspects of the communicative ability by many international language test providers. As such, teachers and language teaching institutions feel committed to helping learners promote their fluency for communication and/or certification purposes. Given this broad interest and significance, fluency has become a progressive area of research with findings that shed light on its complex and multidimensional construct, offering ground-breaking implications for professional practice. Such findings, however, are not often translated into practice or used by the relevant practitioners. In this talk after providing a background to L2 fluency research, I will discuss the findings of three recent studies I have been involved in. Discussing the results and underlining the contributions these studies have made to the field, I will discuss how professional practice in applied linguistics can benefit from the findings of this body of research.\nProfessor Parvaneh Tavakoli\nUniversity of Reading, United Kingdom\nParvaneh Tavakoli is Professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of Reading. Parvaneh's main research interest lies in the interface of second language acquisition, language teaching, and language testing. She is specifically interested in task-based language teaching, task design and development of oral fluency in second language acquisition. Parvaneh has led several international research projects investigating second language performance, acquisition, assessment, and policy in different contexts. She has disseminated her research in the form of articles in prestigious peer-reviewed journals (e.g., The Modern Language Journal, SSLA and Language Learning), policy reports (e.g., Report to Welsh Government), and books by key publishers (e.g., Cambridge University Press and TESOL Press). Her latest monograph \"Comprehensibility in Language Testing\" will soon be published by Equinox. ",

  "text": "Cancer accounts for the highest mortality in the world with 1 out of 6 of death related to its prevalence or cancer-related complications. With the last resort, Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) is the most common form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients in the United States (14.2%), China (55%) and Taiwan (64%). TCM is already widely accepted by mainland Chinese physicians due to the history, culture, and politics of the People’s Republic of China, with 98% having received TCM training. Hong Kong is a window to bridge clinical practice to the global context. Thus, the experience gained in this study must be able to advance global multi-disciplinary medical industry for recommendation. \nThis talk takes top down and bottom-up approaches to discuss a model of integrative medicine in cancer care. This will help in identifying perceived gaps in the treatment and collaboration among cancer patients, their caregivers, oncologists, nurse, administrator, pharmacist, dispensary and Chinese Medicine Practitioners. The results will help guide strategies to improve patient-centered actions relating to cancer treatment and survivorship.\nThis was the first in depth case study to investigate the cancer care from physician and patients in Hong Kong on both industries. A patient-centered approach has been used to analyse the priorities of the care in current process of care. The success of the model could be determined by the 1) number of enrolled patients; 2) a clinical audit; 3) the liver, renal functions or blood report of cancer patients before or after this medical care; 4) patients’ satisfaction of the medical service or 5) internal staff of evaluation of the process of care. The analysis considered of the effectiveness, safety, adverse effect, drug-related symptoms, or cost, that was explored from the key stakeholders of the medical industry in Hong Kong. With the global trend of Integrative Medicine, this study could facilitate inter-professional communication for improving the clinical management of cancer in Chinese in the private sector.",

  "text": "Professor Jonathan Culpeper\nMany of my talks about impoliteness look backwards, surveying what has happened over the decades and concluding with the current state-of-the-art. This talk focuses on the future, and specifically my future work, which I hope will be of some interest. I am involved in three different projects, each at varying stages of completion, and each involving different groups of collaborators. The first is in tune with my sense that sometimes the linguistic side of (im)politeness is overlooked, particularly given the dominance of discursive and/or post-modern approaches. We have been looking at the grammar of impoliteness, and specifically you + np structures (e.g. you idiot) across English, Dutch and Polish. The second is distinctive in its use of corpus methods. We have been examining the distribution of numerous politeness expressions (please, thank you, sir, goodbye, etc.) in the British National Corpus 2014 across the social and contextual categories recorded in the metadata (e.g. geographical location; public versus private). The third is notable for its challenging data. We are investigating impoliteness online, and in particular the notion of reciprocity. This raises all sorts of challenges, not least of which is that much of (im)politeness theory assumes a speaker addressing a hearer face-to-face with no overhearing audience. Our particular innovation here is that we are going to try to quantify specific interactive features (and produce visualisations of them), in order to highlight what might be distinctive about online impoliteness. In this talk, I will give the flavour of each of the three research projects, covering the aims, issues and early results.",
