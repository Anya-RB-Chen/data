  "text": "Welcome to PolyU LMS website.\nLogistics has a long history. Even before it was methodically structured as a business specialty, people have been practising it. Nowadays, logistics is a complex business science, an important arm in running a business. Therefore, the Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies strives to cultivate professionals to serve organisation in the modern world through education and research.\nOur undergraduate and postgraduate programmes cover an extensive range of topics in logistics, maritime studies, operations management, quality management, shipping, and supply chain relationships. The programmes are delivered by distinguished faculty dedicated to combine academic excellence and real-world experience. In recent years, the Department has been working to extend our expertise into aviation management and logistics to meet with the burgeoning importance of aviation management. We actively responded by launching the BBA (Hons) in Aviation Management and Logistics programme. This programme is the only government-funded and aviation-related Bachelor of Business Administration programme in Hong Kong. By introducing this programme, we aim to nurture young talents to join the world’s largest international air cargo hub, and provide expertise to the aviation industry.\nRegarding our research, we aim at creating new knowledge and developing streamlined solutions for the industry and the society at large, enabling the world to work in a more effective manner. Moreover, with the meticulous work of our academics, our research in maritime studies, shipping and port ranks highly around the world. We have a group of world-class scholars in the areas of supply chain and operations management, and maritime and transportation studies.\nWe sincerely invite you to explore our website to learn about our programme, our cutting-edge research, and our distinguished faculty. We look forward to walking the path of your life journey together with you.",

  "text": "Background\nTo cope with the rapid development of logistics in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland with mounting demand for talents, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) officially established the Department of Logistics on 1 September 2003, after a reorganisation incorporating the former Department of Shipping and Transport Logistics and part of the former Department of Management.\nIn September 2008, PolyU made another move to rename the Department as Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies to better reflect the Department's strengths and growing portfolio. Currently, PolyU is the sole provider of maritime education at the tertiary level in Hong Kong.\n\nMajor Achievements\nSince its establishment, the Department has attained encouraging achievements with wide recognition from the industries, professional bodies and the government.\nHighlights of some major developments include:\nNamed as one of the \"Best Ten Universities in Logistics in China for the Year 2006\" by the \"China Logistics Development Annual Conference\";\nEstablished the CY Tung International Centre for Maritime Studies in 2007 with the generous support from The Tung Foundation for its further advancement;\nEstablished the Hong Kong Maritime Scholarship Scheme in 2007 with the donation of HK$4 million from the HKSAR Government to support students enrolled in the MSc in International Shipping and Transport Logistics;\nEstablished the Hong Kong Nautical and Maritime Scholarship Scheme, which consists of two prongs - \"Seafaring Scholarship\" and \"Maritime Scholarship\" in 2018 with funding support from the HKSAR Government to attract local students to join the BBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics programme.\nFounded different scholarship schemes with donations from reputed organisations including the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, Pacific Basin Shipping (Hong Kong) Ltd., Shun Tak China Travel Ship Management Limited, DHL Global Forwarding (Hong Kong) Limited;\nLaunched the BBA (Hons) in Aviation Management and Logistics, a two-year full-time top-up degree programme, in September 2017.\nThe Department's BBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics programme was accorded with ICSTCW status, the only university in Hong Kong recognized by International Maritime Organization;\nThe Department's BBA (Hons) and MSc programmes in Global Supply Chain Management received professional recognition from four professional bodies, including the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Hong Kong (CILTHK), the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), the International Institution of Management (IIM), and the Institute of Purchasing & Supply of Hong Kong (IPSHK).\nQuality Education\nWith major areas of specialisation in \"global supply chain\" and \"international shipping and transport logistics\", the Department offers comprehensive and internationally recognised academic programmes ranging from undergraduate to postgraduate levels. The primary aims are to nurture highly effective logistics managers and leaders through the development of contemporary educational materials and the use of innovative and teaching methods.\nThe Department's master's programmes in Global Supply Chain Management, International Shipping and Transport Logistics, and Operations Management offer in-depth knowledge to managers and professionals in the field, and they embody a sound balance between academic theory and professional practice. The MSc programme in International Shipping and Transport Logistics, for example, covers not only maritime knowledge, but also practical subjects such as port policy and management, shipping law, and marine insurance.\nThe Department also actively collaborates with top-tier institutions on the Chinese mainland. One of these initiatives was the launch of its flagship Master of Science in Quality Management with the Zhejiang University in Zhejiang. Drawing on the academic profile of the Department, the programme attracted candidates from different backgrounds including banking and finance, catering and restaurant, construction, engineering, government departments, health care, hotel, logistics, merchandising, production, property management, public utilities, purchasing, quality testing and certification, retailing, tourism, trading, transportation, warehousing, and other service industries.\nInnovative Research\nIn line with PolyU's tradition, the Department has placed strong emphasis on innovative research in various areas covering maritime, shipping, ports, supply chain management and transport logistics. The academic staff have been rigorously engaging in research activities, witnessed by the growing number of research papers published in top-quality academic journals.\nThe designation of some projects as niche areas by the University further signifies the department's excellence in research ideas and activities.\nIndustrial Collaboration\nAs a centre of excellence in logistics and maritime education for nurturing professional talents, the Department also strives to provide research and consultancy services for the business community. With close collaboration with the industries, application and real world connection, the Department can bring the highest quality of teaching, research and consultancy into classes, which will bring benefits for the industry and the community as a whole. It is what PolyU makes a difference in logistics and maritime education.",

We are pleased to announce the following awardees of the Outstanding Alumni Award of PolyU Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies 2023 for their remarkable achievements.\nMr Huang Yang - Outstanding Young Alumni Award in Professional Achievement 2023\nMr Huang Yang has won 25 championship trophies for the club in his 12 years career as a captain of the Kitchee Football Team and the Hong Kong Football Representative team.\nAside from that, he also won the Hong Kong Footballer of the Year award in 2013 and four times won the Best Eleven award.\nMr Huang Yang has played 68 matches for the Hong Kong Representative Team so far and has led the team to the historic moment in 2023 Asian Cup Final since Hong Kong had not participated in the competition for 56 years.\nMr Law Lap Keung - Outstanding Alumni Award in Professional Achievement 2023\nAfter graduating in 1998, our alumnus Mr Law Lapkeung joined Orient Overseas Container Line Co., Ltd. and worked his way up from a deck cadet to obtaining the qualification of Master Mariner in ten years. Driven by a passion for public service, sustainable port and shipping development, and contributing to the country, Mr Law made the decision to join the Marine Department. Over the next 15 years, he was promoted from a Marine Officer to an Assistant Director, where he oversaw numerous large-scale projects and port operations and formulated several new plans for port optimization, personnel training, and further education. \nDuring the pandemic period, Mr Law closely monitored the movement of various waterways, coordinated the operation of various ports, and oversaw epidemic prevention measures and the supply of materials at various terminals. Thanks to his efforts, Hong Kong was able to resume the supply of daily necessities such as vegetables and meat in a short period of time.\nCurrently, Mr Law is still working on various aspects of port facilities, safety, and management, which involves people, machines, materials, and laws of all parties, ultimately aiming for sustainable development of the maritime industry.\nMr Law has a deep connection to PolyU and has returned to his alma mater several times to help promote our department and participate in events aimed at explaining opportunities for joining the shipping industry.

  "text": "Aims\nThe Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies aims to offer students something more meaningful outside the curriculum. Through the Industrial Mentorship Programme, we provide students with access to experienced professionals who can provide practical advice and guidance on students' readiness to enter the workplace.\nThrough informal social interactions, mentors will share their valuable past experience, show their working environment, talk about their insights, answer mentees’ queries, demonstrate exemplary practices, and inspire new thoughts. In addition to providing learning experiences supplementary to those obtained in the campus, a successful mentor-mentee relationship will often result in important and beneficial change of attitude.\nOur Mentees\nAll Senior Year 1, Year 3 and Final Year students of the BBA (Hons) in Aviation Management and Logistics (BBA-AML), BBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management (BBA-GSCM) and BBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics (BBA-ISTL) are eligible to join this programme.\nAll mentees must take initiative to participate in the mentorship programme to get guidance from their mentors.\nOur Industrial Mentors\nOur department will invite experienced and professional mentors from the industry to provide guidance and advice to our mentees. Our alumni, current MSc students as well as industrial partners will also be recruited to join the mentorship programme. Each mentor will take care of 2-3 mentees according to the mentees’ career interest and background.\nRole of a Mentor\nA mentor is a mature, wise and caring member of the business world who agrees to commit his/her personal time to coach his/her mentees. Our mentors will:\nfoster a caring and supportive relationship\nencourage the mentee to develop to his/her fullest potential\nhelp the mentee to develop his/her vision and aspiration for future\nMentoring is a structured relationship, which means that the two parties are expected to have some interaction within a specified time frame. It will be most helpful for both mentor and mentee, in the initial stage, to agree on the level of commitment, mode and frequency of interaction, as well as the preferred focus, such as:\ndevelopment of professional / business acumen\nbecoming a leader\nguidance in all-round development\ncareer exploration\ngoal setting\ncommunity involvement, e.g. volunteer work\nexploring new frontiers\nDuration\n8 months, from November to June every year.\nActivities\nThere is no fixed mode or frequency of interaction. During the 8-month mentorship period, two to three face-to-face meetings will be organised for group interaction. Mentees should take the initiative to seek guidance from mentors to maintain the good relationship with their mentors.\nOur mentors and mentees can enjoy the privilege to join the activities, including alumni gatherings, outings (such as hiking) and career talks organised by the Logistics Alumni Associate (LGTAA). Our mentees will also have the higher priority for enrolling the departmental activities, such as firm visits, departmental gathering (such as BBQ), etc.\nEnrolment\nEnrolment for 2021/22 academic year is closed.\nIf you are interested to be our mentor, please feel free to send us an email (lms.enquiry@polyu.edu.hk).",

  "text": "Hands-on learning\nThrough connections with its alumni, the Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies offered us a golden opportunity to complete an internship at Walgreens Boots Alliance, a world-renowned logistics company. During the internship, we worked alongside staff members to assist in different departments’ daily duties.\nWe were given project ownership and defined the topic, carried out research and presented our recommendations in the presence of the Asia-Pacific directors. One of the most exciting parts of the experience was getting a restricted area permit to visit a cargo aircraft (not the passenger aircraft we usually take).\nNetworking\nI also had the chance to learn from my mentors who are experienced professionals and alumni of the department. They were very supportive and took time out of their busy schedules to guide us. My mentor was the general manager of a listed company in Hong Kong for years. He taught me to be ambitious and proactive and brought me along to a lot of events and courses.\nWhen another mentee needed to find a logistics company for her final year project, he immediately contacted his friends to find connections. As for the mentor assigned by department, he was also willing to help. When I had to make decisions before a very tight deadline, he responded instantly via WhatsApp. I am so happy to have such supportive and caring alumni as my mentors.\nInternational exposure\nIn my third year, I was nominated by PolyU to join an exchange programme at the National University of Singapore for one semester. Classes were different from Hong Kong. One of the courses I took there was Itadakimasu – Food in Japan. It was a cross-discipline course on how food, history, economies, politics and culture affect each other. We had tasting sessions during lectures. Professors even arranged a tea ceremony for us as a tutorial. The class was very innovative and enjoyable.\nMoreover, I developed valuable friendships with my hall mates, chit chatting overnight along the corridor. When they came to Hong Kong last summer to visit me, I took them around Hong Kong as they had done for me back in Singapore. We had site visits to some Singaporean logistics firms, where I discovered that Singaporeans and Singaporean firms are very open-minded and creative. \nConnecting with communities\nApart from attending lectures as a student, I also actively participated in community service locally and overseas. As students, we want to be able to contribute to society. I developed teaching kits to teach English to children in rural Chinese villages, in hopes of raising their interest in learning English through storytelling. In a leadership programme organised by PolyU, I also went to Israel to discuss ethnicity issues with local youth to understand the relationship between Jews and Arabs. I also spoke with locals to learn how to develop entrepreneurship.\nJessica Chuen Sui-ting\nCurrent Student of BBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics (Year 4)\nDuring my years as a Global Supply Chain Management major, I took an extensive range of courses related to supply chain management. Most of the courses were taught by industry veterans with solid connections and experience. As such, we were able to make frequent visits to industry companies and interesting places such as shipping dockyards to engage with professionals.\nIn one of the courses I took, the lecturer who was a maritime logistics and operations expert, took us to a marine service provider. The company provided ship repair, harbour towage and shipping related engineering service. I got to see an actual tugboat and the equipment introduced in our lectures. We also visited the operation room and learned about the different processes of dockyard operations and the information system.\nApart from a well-rounded academic experience, my time at PolyU was made remarkable because of the people I met. I was chosen as a mentor in the Department’s “mentorship programme”, a programme that connects freshmen with senior students to provide support and guidance as they transition from secondary school to university through various activities. The department arranged outings to Disneyland and the Ocean Park, for example, for mentors and mentees to get to know each other better and form a bond in a relaxing environment. We had so much fun and made precious memories, and eventually become good friends.\nI feel grateful to have had the opportunity to attend insightful and practical courses and made some lifelong friends.\nRick Hong Shuheng (left)\nCurrent Student of BBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management (Year 4)\nDuring my years as a Global Supply Chain Management major student, I took an extensive range of courses related to supply chain management.

It was the first time I ever got to travel out of Asia, let alone live in a foreign country on my own, so it was pretty intimidating at first. I spent 6 months in Germany and I decided it was a good time to pick up a new language. Unlike Hong Kong, Germany is not a bilingual country and you rarely see English translations on signs, so I signed up for a beginner’s German class.\nThe learning culture in Germany was quite different from what I'm used to in Hong Kong. It emphasises self-learning and curiosity. During lectures, students were eager to raise questions.\nStill, I made some very good friends from different parts of the world, with whom I still keep in touch with today. Together we travelled to many neighbouring countries, including Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Denmark. As an avid photographer I took the chance to explore the many beautiful landscapes these countries have to offer. The cultural differences within members in our travel group did not stop us from understanding each other. Instead, we became closer through getting to know each other through our travels and ruling out misconceptions we held previously.\nMy internship experience at Siemens also deserves a mention. The 3-month internship provided a solid foundation to build my career in the logistics industry. Unlike conventional big companies, the laid-back working environment meant I was rarely given strict procedures to follow and was encouraged to raise questions.\nThere was an incident during my internship where a shipping schedule was disrupted by a typhoon. The shipment was unable to arrive on time. I assisted my supervisor in rearranging the shipment and liaised freight details with forwarders. That was an exhausting day but it was a worthwhile experience that really sharpened my ability to improvise.\nJanice Li Pui-man (centre)\nCurrent Student of BBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management (Year 3)\nTime has passed in the blink of an eye and this is my last year at PolyU. Looking back, I have participated in various activities in that have enriched my university life.\nPolyU is a place where I have met friends that I will cherish for life. I remember how I met my first group of friends at the student halls of residence. I first moved into the halls 3 years ago and I have never felt bored living there because there are always people there you can hang around with. We have spent numerous sleepless nights chatting, watching movies and playing games in each other’s rooms.\nI am an avid traveller and the past three years at PolyU have given me a lot of opportunities to explore the world and gain a global perspective with visits to various countries. I was an exchange student at Ryerson University in Canada for a semester. During that time, I made friends with people from different parts of the world and learned about different cultures. I remember there was an “International Night” dinner event where we sat together sharing traditional dishes from our hometowns.\nLast summer, I went to Hangzhou as part of Service Learning, a compulsory course at our university. Service Learning is different from other voluntary works. Throughout the project, teachers guided us on how to promote positive youth development for underprivileged children and adolescents on the mainland.\nTowards the end of the project, we went to a primary school in Hangzhou and practised the theories and skills that we had learnt. We provided educational support for a week. We built close relationships with students and the experience has definitely been rewarding and memorable to me.\nAs a student of global supply chain management, our university and department has given us a lot of work-related opportunities. Last year, I joined a study tour organised by our department to the UK where we paid visits to different ports and companies such as Tesco and John Lewis. We learned from professionals of related fields about real-world business operations.\nI also joined the aviation practicum programme last year, where I visited top airlines and airports as well as received professional training on knowledge and skills of the aviation industry. I even worked as student consultant for Hong Kong Airlines Limited and gained hands-on experience.\nApart from academic knowledge, my friends and all the valuable experiences and memories are the key takeaways from my years at PolyU that I will cherish forever.\nSophie Ng Yuen-wa (centre)\nCurrent Student of BBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management (Year 4)\nMy internship experience in Melbourne, Australia gave me a taste of working at a culturally diverse working environment. I worked as a Purchasing and Operations Intern at Alloys International - the Non-Traditional Distributor, where its Melbourne office is home to partners and staff from around the globe.This experience truly opened my eyes to the operations in Australian companies and the different methods they use when compared with local or Chinese firms.\nWhile working with the Purchasing and Operations team, I gained a wide range of knowledge and learned about different techniques such as the calculation of DIFOT (delivery in full, on time) and fill rate, transferral of stocks between warehouses, and how to draw warehouse layouts, to name but a few.\nAlloys provided me with a lot of opportunities to really understand and learn how a distributor runs its business, as well as the way they embrace its “non-traditional” values to both buyer and supplier.\nAlloys' laid-back working environment made going to work every day very enjoyable. I always heard laughter coming from every corner of the office. I am grateful that my colleagues, including the CEO and my supervisor, were so supportive and motivating during my time there.\nThey did their best to make me feel at home and were always patient with me. They never turned away my questions and were willing to help when I encountered difficulties.\nWhen I was not working at the Alloys office or on-site with the Purchasing and Operations team, I spent my time exploring the city of Melbourne. I met new friends who also came from PolyU, and we spent a lot of time travelling around. Australia is a place where the beauty of life is all around us, and is home to species such as koalas and kangaroos.\nThe natural landscapes of Australia were magnificent, places like the Twelve Apostles, Phillip Island, Mornington Island and Brighton Beach had breathtaking views. The most memorable trip I took was to Tasmania for a weekend. It is undeniably a paradise on earth - the sight of Cradle Mountain was unforgettable.\nI am honoured to have been selected to participate in this program and would like to thank PolyU and Alloys International for this incredible opportunity. I have made connections and memories that will last a lifetime. I had an excellent time during my time in Melbourne and highly recommend future interns to pursue this opportunity.\nHorace Poon Cheuk-lai (centre)\nCurrent Student of BBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics (Year 4)\nDuring the summer break of my sophomore year, I joined the Shanghai WIE (work-integrated education) programme where I did an internship with the industry-leading international logistics company, Kuehne + Nagel. The experience not only gave me the chance to put the logistics knowledge acquired from classes in a real-life work setting, but also insights into actual business operations in freight forwarding. I also consider this internship experience as a good chance for self-evaluation. Through daily work and communication with colleges, I understood myself better - my abilities, career interests, and areas in need of improvement.\nAs my university life comes to an end, I have come to realise that what I gained here at PolyU is much more than just a degree - it's also about having the ability to be a fast learner with solid work experience, because ultimately, these are the values that will take me into the ever-changing world when I graduate.\nTinsley Zhang Ting (centre)\nCurrent Student of BBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management (Year 4)",

Supply chain management is getting more and more important in business sectors nowadays. It is one of the pivotal elements to lead a company to stay competitive and be successful. This programme equips me with well-rounded and practical knowledge in SCM topics like operations management, purchasing management, and information technology. After graduation, I worked in supply chain department at several renowned global companies. I love supply chain and I am proud of being one of the graduates from this programme.\nAmy Chan\nEstée Lauder (H.K.) Ltd.\nBBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management Graduate - 2009\nThe BBA in International Shipping & Transport Logistics programme provided me with a wide range of logistics and shipping knowledge, and empowered me to step into shipping industry.\nBesides classroom subjects, we also had the opportunity to join international study tours thanks to the support from the Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies. I took part in the study tours to China and the UK, both were delightful experiences that have broadened my horizons and strengthened my understanding of the practical world of shipping and logistics.\nAfter graduation, I served Hong Kong shipowner for 8 years, while contributed to the Hong Kong maritime industry in various industry associations.\nBuilt on the international exposure and experience from PolyU, now I am working for a shipowner in Canada on commercial side. The Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies is my recommendation for the bright road to success in logistics and shipping industry.\nDavin Chan\nMarketing & Customer Service Representative, CSL International Ltd.\nMSc in International Shipping and Transport Logistics Graduate - 2011\nBBA (Hons) International Shipping and Transport Logistics Graduate - 2009\nTracy Chan\nGard (HK) Ltd.\nBBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics Graduate - 2007\nThe Global Supply Chain Management programme at PolyU has helped me build a solid foundation and equipped me with the necessary knowledge and skills to begin my career in the field. Supply chain management skills are highly sought-after in a wide range of industries, and the GSCM programme opens doors to career opportunities in roles ranging from demand planning, logistics to procurement. Upon graduation, I took up demand and supply planning roles in various industries and was immediately able to apply what I learned from my study. After gaining a few years of industry experience, I went on to pursue a Masters degree in Supply Chain Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where I got the chance to dive deeper into the field and connect with supply chain professionals across the globe. Upon graduation from MIT, I joined Google as a Supply Planning Program Manager to continue work in areas that I am passionate about.\nVicky Chan\nSupply Planning Program Manager, Google Hong Kong\nMaster of Applied Science (MASc) in Supply Chain Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology - 2018\nBBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management Graduate - 2011\nMaking a subject choice for university is always a difficult task. To a large extent it reflects how your future will be. I chose supply chain and logistics as it is a very practical industry. Logistics is about more than just transportation and warehouses, and shipping is not just sailing a ship on the sea.\nIt is a meticulous process connecting business, government regulations, people management and engineering. Using the most efficient and effective way to move goods around the world is a challenging and interesting task. I enjoy the ever-changing work and lifestyle of the industry.\nMy study experience at PolyU Logistics granted me theoretical and practical knowledge in the logistics and supply chain industry. As a student, I was equipped with market insights, international exposure and interpersonal skills, through various workshops and interactive classes and lectures.\nWe also had the chance to meet industry professionals in social events and company visits. The department also organises cross disciplinary activities with the Faculty of Business and PolyU, where we had the chance to interact with students from other disciplines.\nRaymond Cheng\nDirector – Middle East, Kerry Logistics\nBBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management Graduate - 2010\nSilvia Ho\nAssociate Director, Arcadis Consultancy Hong Kong Limited\nBBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management Graduate - 2010\nStudying the GSCM programme at PolyU is definitely a rewarding experience for me.\nAcademically, the programme offers selection flexibility in elective subjects, which allows me to specialise in the areas that interest me most. The class size is relatively small, so I get to know my classmates well. We were assigned to work on group projects for almost every subject, which sharpened my teamwork and presentation skills. All these have shown the effort of the programme to develop well-rounded business students.\nApart from the intellectual aspects, the Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies is very supportive and accessible. Professors respond to our emails quite fast and we never have a problem getting appointments with them or seeking for advice. The Department also provides study tours, company visits, and other meaningful activities with different industry associations. We were able to gain wonderful industry exposure as students.\nIn summary, the four-year GSCM learning experience has not only equipped me with invaluable business knowledge and market insights, but also trained me to become versatile and thus competitive in the job market. I am now taking my Master of Financial Economics degree at Oxford. I believe what I gained from the GSCM program will continue to play a role in my future academic and professional career, and the impact will be long-lasting.\nCatherine Mo\nStudent of Oxford MSc Financial Economic programme at Saïd Business School\nBBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management Graduate - 2016\nCyrus Ng\nOperations Director, Landbridge Holdings Limited\nBBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics Graduate - 2008\nAlexander Siu has over 7 years of experience in the shipping industry.

Alexander said the PolyU-LMS definitely is the cradle for most maritime professionals in Hong Kong. He is delighted to be pursuing his third programme in shipping logistics offered by LMS, which affirms his maritime career in bulk-shipping industry.\n“During my bachelor’s degree in shipping & logistics, I joined an international study tour to Singapore for company visits. The tour complemented my operational knowledge that I gained from the higher diploma program. The tour also gave me the opportunity to collaborate and work with international partners and experts in the field, enlightened me with global perspective and ignited my passion in the future development of my shipping career. I am especially grateful for the dynamic courses taught at bachelor and higher diploma levels, allowing me to acquire fundamental ship management, shipping law, and marine insurance knowledge.”\nAlexander expressed that he is truly blessed to have joined the exchange program in Denmark, to him, it was a very precious and unforgettable experience. “The program has not only strengthened my academic knowledge, but also improved my independent living skills and positive uplifting attitude.”\n“The MSc in International Shipping and Transport Logistics programme is a leading and widely recognized master’s programme in Hong Kong.

If you are interested in, or have the will to devote to logistics industry especially in the maritime sector, programmes offered by LMS are the best options to equip yourself to become a competent, capable and well-qualified practitioner.” Alexander said.\nAlexander Siu\nOperations Manager, KC Maritime\nMSc in International Shipping and Transport Logistics Graduate - 2016\nBBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics Graduate - 2014\nHigher Diploma in International Transport Logistics Graduate - 2012\nAnthony Tai\nSale & Purchase Director, Clarksons Platou\nBBA (Hons) in International Shipping and Transport Logistics Graduate - 2008\nThe multi-faceted Global Supply Chain Management programme at PolyU has been proven beneficial for my future. Through intensive report writing, group projects and presentations in courses, I was trained to be a team player and a professional business student. Insightful case studies in class were useful and have developed my interest in the consulting industry. Apart from that, the internship I took part in was where I was able to apply my practical knowledge from class in a work setting.\nI participated in an exchange programme to HEC Montreal which broadened my horizons with international exposure. I became more confident in expressing my opinions and was motivated to learn more about the logistics and supply chain industry.\nAfter graduation I worked as a business analyst in the supply chain department, and it is the learning experience in PolyU that fostered my interest to deep dive in the logistics industry. I am very grateful for my education at PolyU and the solid foundation it has laid for my future career.\nWendi Wang\nBusiness Analyst, Meituan\nMaster of Philosophy (MPhil) student of Industrial Systems Manufacture Management at the University of Cambridge\nBBA (Hons) in Global Supply Chain Management Graduate - 2017\nLike most people, I am not acquainted with shipping and aviation industry before I get in touch with the BBA in International Shipping and Transport Logistics programme. It guides me to discover the industries gradually. From providing basic knowledge through delivering lectures, connecting with senior fellow alumni at academic events, to experiencing the real logistics operations through company visits. Thanks to the foundation and network that ISTL programme gives me, upon graduation, I became an employee of PASCO, an airline general sales & service agent. My job not only includes general office operations, but also need to be at ramp side to take care of the actual aircraft and cargo operation. ISTL programme brings me to the aviation industry. With the knowledge I got from university, I have earned the beginning of a fruitful career, and I look forward to the challenges in the future!\nIvy Wong\nPacific Air Services Co.

  "text": "Title: Competition in Congested Service Networks with Application to Air Traffic Control Provision in Europe\nSpeaker: Prof. Nicole Adler, Professor, Operations Research Department, The Jerusalem School of Business Administration, Hebrew University of Jerusalem\nDate: 29 April 2020\nAbstract:\nWe analyze how a network based market impacts competition, equilibrium charges and efficiency. We find that congested networks served by oligopolistic firms within a supply chain may be more cost efficient and offer lower prices under horizontal integration as compared to the competitive outcome. Furthermore, if a government is interested in encouraging technology adoption in order to increase capacity, this requires either hybrid price caps or vertical integration in order to share both the costs and benefits. The model is subsequently illustrated with a case study on air traffic control provision in Western Europe, in which it is shown that substantial changes in the regulation are required in order to create a more cost efficient sector with increased capacity.\nBio:\nNicole Adler is a professor and head of the Department of Operations Research and Operations Management at the School of Business Administration of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Her major research interests include game theory and productivity estimation applied to the field of transportation. Her work has analysed huband-spoke airline competition and mergers, public service obligation tenders, airport productivity and recently, she has utilised game theoretic concepts in order to understand air traffic control markets. Nicole is currently an associate editor for Transportation Research part B: Methodological.",

  "text": "It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the 13th POMS-HK International Conference. The Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University is delighted to host this prominent Conference again after previously hosting it in 2009 and 2016. It is also particularly meaningful to be able to meet some of you on the PolyU campus after the unprecedented disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nThe theme of this year’s Conference is “POM for a Better World: Accountable, Adaptive, and Agile”. We are well aware that globalisation had until recently been increasing interdependence amongst players along the supply chain. The extended period of COVID has undoubtedly disrupted these interdependent supply and production networks, which formally span the globe. The impact of COVID is irreversible and has forced businesses to rethink how they manage the supply chain that is vital to their survival.\nThe call to be accountable, adaptable, and agile is certainly the clue to a better future for all of us. We need to reach a collective understanding and, more importantly, a consensus, about what it means to be accountable, adaptive, and agile, so that we can proactively deal with “risks” and stay resilient. These “risks” are not only those that are still hindering the complete recovery of production in the aftermath of COVID, but also those associated with other forces, such as ESG compliance and digital transformation. How businesses choose to deal with such risks may affect how business will be carried out in the future.\nThe Conference has brought together many experts in the field. The discussions promise to shed light on how academics and practitioners can work hand in hand to embrace the challenges that lie ahead.\nI wish the Conference every success and look forward to meeting you in person or online.\nIr Prof. T.C. Edwin Cheng\nIASCYS Academician, FHKEng, ScD, PhD\nDean, Faculty of Business\nFung Yiu King – Wing Hang Bank Professor in Business Administration\nChair Professor of Management\nWelcome Message from the Head of the Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies\nI have the great pleasure in welcoming you to The 13th POMS-HK International Conference. It is our honour to host this distinguished event for the third time. The Conference provides a valuable opportunity for scholars not only in Hong Kong but all over the world to get together, sharing their experiences and perspectives on current research developments and events of interest in the field of production and operations management (POM).\nThe theme of the Conference this year is “POM for a Better World: Accountable, Adaptive, and Agile”. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is an increasingly important topic for business and the theme of the Conference this year provides a timely platform for scholars to share their latest studies in this area particularly. We have faced enormous challenges throughout the years, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020. Many of us have not been able to get together physically for some years due to travel restrictions in many places. This conference marks an important step toward closer collaboration among scholars across borders in the POM community.\nI look forward to meeting you all at this prominent event, and we wish all of you a fruitful event.\nProf. Andy C. L. Yeung\nHead, Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies\nChair Professor of Operations Management\nWelcome Message from Associate Executive Director, Global Initiatives & Outreach, POMS & President, POMS\nIt is my distinct pleasure to welcome you all to The 13th POMS-HK International Conference, January 7th – 8th, 2023.\nThe planning team has done an incredible job under the direction of the General Chair, Andy Yeung, Organizing Committee Chair Yulan Wang, and Program Committee Chairs, Miao Song, Kai Pan, and Judy Tong. Special thanks to the leadership team in the Business School at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for hosting this conference.\nThe 13th POMS-HK International Conference would not be possible without the intensive efforts of the organizing committee and the program committee, along with the session organizers, best paper award chairs, and job fair chair who have worked tirelessly to support all facets of this meeting.

  "text": "Can I attend the conference online?\nYes. The conference will adopt a hybrid mode with both online presentation and in-person presentation on The Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus.\nDo I need a visa to attend the conference?\nAs any international inbound travelers can pass by and stay in Hong Kong for seven days, and our conference is for at most three days. It is enough for any conference participant.\nCitizen from about 170 countries can visit HK without visa. Please see the webpage for the visa requirements for different countries: https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/visit-transit/visit-visa-entry-permit.html\nWhat are the current arrival and quarantine arrangements for inbound persons?\nPlease refer to this link: https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel.html\nCan I leave Hong Kong during the medical surveillance period?\nThere is no departure restriction on persons under medical surveillance. However, persons travelling from Hong Kong to the Mainland or Macao are subject to the special testing arrangement (https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/special-outbound-test.html) to undergo an additional free rapid nucleic acid test prior to their departure via land boundary control points (BCPs) or the airport. Only those who received a negative result can continue with their journeys. To prevent the exportation of cases and to support the nation's anti-epidemic efforts, persons subject to Amber Code restrictions are not allowed to undergo the relevant special nucleic acid test at land BCPs or the airport, meaning that inbound persons from overseas places or Taiwan are not allowed to transit to the Mainland or Macao within the three days upon arrival at Hong Kong.\nHow to define the period of relevant travel history?\nThe relevant travel history is back counted from the reference day as Day 0, then back count for 7 days. i.e. if 26 Sep 2022 is the reference day, then the period of relevant travel history counts from 19 to 26 Sep 2022.\nWhat if a person misreports his travel history?\nThe Prevention and Control of Disease (Disclosure of Information) Regulation (Cap. 599D) empowers authorised officers to require any person to provide or disclose information that is relevant to identification and tracing of persons who may be at risk of contracting the disease, such as travel history, places they have visited or people they have come into contact with, etc. in relation to the prevention and control of the spread of diseases. A person commits a criminal offence if he / she fails to comply with the requirement to provide information, or gives to an authorised officer any false or misleading information. The maximum penalty for such offence is a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months. The Centre for Health Protection will, through its hotlines (183 0111), allow members of the public to verify the identity of authorised officers if necessary.\nThe personal data obtained for COVID-19 contact tracing will only be used by the Department of Health or relevant department(s) for epidemic prevention purposes, and the arrangements for handling the personal data would be in strict compliance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486).\nIf I transit via Hong Kong without entering Hong Kong, would the quarantine measures be applicable to me?\nQuarantine measures are only applicable to persons who enter Hong Kong. The quarantine requirement does not apply to transit passenger who arrives at the Hong Kong International Airport or enters the waters of Hong Kong solely for the purpose of leaving Hong Kong and, while in Hong Kong, does not pass through immigration control.\nDo I need to comply with the respective boarding requirements applicable to Taiwan/overseas places if I just transit at Taiwan/overseas places with layover inside the airport terminal without passing through the immigration control point (i.e. have not entered the specified place)?\nOnly inbound persons satisfying all the following conditions during transit, will be regarded as NOT having stayed in Taiwan/overseas places: \na person boarded, in a place, a conveyance that, after the person had boarded it, stopped at Taiwan/overseas places; and\nthe person did not leave the conveyance in Taiwan/overseas places; and\nthe person’s journey on that conveyance ended subsequently outside Taiwan/overseas places.\nTherefore, once the inbound person leaves the aircraft during stopover at Taiwan/overseas places, the inbound person will be regarded as having stayed in Taiwan/overseas places, thus the inbound person has to comply with the requirements specified.",

  "text": "IMCC Special Session on Quantitative Analysis in Shipping and Aviation\nOrganized by the IMC-Frank Tsao Maritime Library and R&D Centre (IMCC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), this session starts with the topic “Quantitative Analysis in Shipping and Aviation” which is composed of three related studies. First, we discuss the modelling port call decisions of liner shipping services in a contestable market. Second, we examine the lifespan of world merchant fleet. Third, we analyze the stated preference on the heterogeneous behavior in airfare choice.\nThe number of ports to call is the essential information for liner service design, which also affects the decision on port development and capacity expansion. This study models the relationship between ship size and port call numbers in a contestable route with single or two players. In the single player model, the player determines the optimal number of port calls for a given contestable price. When there are two players, a duopoly model is development to model the optimal price discount and optimal number of port calls.\nThe service life of a ship is a fundamental information for ship-related decision. This study analyzes the lifespan of world merchant ships based on 16,551 ship deletion records since 1990 using Cox PH model. Important factors that affects ships life are identified in the study.\nThis study designed a comprehensive experiment to distinguish the different airfare selection behavior, and tested the validity and stability of the design using simulated data, and applied it in an actual survey on passenger behavior in air-fare selection. The result in such study can improve airlines’ revenue management strategy through better pricing.\nLRC Special Session on Optimization for Logistics Applications\nOrganized by the Logistics Research Center (LRC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), this session includes four talks, which present new optimization methods for various logistics applications.\nThe first talk is about a real-world product distribution problem faced by a fast fashion retailer in Singapore. In this talk, a novel branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm will be presented based on a strong set-partitioning model, where an ad-hoc label-setting algorithm is designed to solve the pricing problem. Extensive computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the new algorithm.\nIn the second talk, a logistics problem in the aftermath of a Mass-Casualty Incident (MCI) will be discussed, for which a new response model will be proposed by considering the transportation resource and medical resource. Different from previous model, this new model assume that the capacity of each hospital as the number of operating rooms and take into account the treatment time for each patient. A mixed integer programming formulation is proposed and solved for the integrated optimization problem that taken into account patient to hospital assignment, ambulance dispatching, and treatment ordering.\nIn the third talk, a study on split delivery vehicle routing problem will be presented, where the demand of a customer needs to be served by a homogeneous fleet of vehicles with the minimum total traveling cost minimized. To tackle this difficult problem, a novel local search algorithm is proposed based on an effective approach to reduce the search space. The new algorithm has significantly outperformed the existing methods. Among the 113 benchmark instances tested, the new algorithm has improved the best-known solutions for 43 instances.\nThe session concludes with a study on a liner shipping network design problem that aims at creating a set of regular services for a designated fleet of oceangoing ships to transport the containerized cargos among seaports. A novel optimization approach is proposed based on simultaneous column and row generation. Results from experiments have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and solution methods.",

  "text": "As a \"global industry\", shipping is inextricably related with international trade. Trade and shipping are two of the most important industries in the world that jointly facilitate global economic growth. Accordingly, the continued growth of international trade supported by shipping-related activities is critical to continuing global economic development. Shipping has evolved from its original relationships with ships and seaborne trade to transporting goods between origins and destinations. Shipping management involves managing a vast network of players consisting of ship owners, shipping service providers, terminal operators, carriers, traders, and policy makers.\nLaunching the Journal of Shipping and Trade (JST) is timely and important to address both theoretical and practical issues associated with managing shipping activities to facilitate and support international trade in today’s dynamic and complex business world. The key focuses of JST include, but are not limited to, trade facilitation, tramp shipping to transport bulk commodities, liner shipping operations, intermodal transport operations, container transport management, terminal management, green shipping management practices, technology adoption for shipping management, and regional planning and policy to promote trade and shipping.\nClick here to visit JST homepage",

  "text": "過往資歷認可機制讓背景各異的從業員所具備的知識、技能和經驗，均可在資歷架構下獲得正式確認。使有志進修的從業員可更容易了解自己在行業內透過經驗或以往工作上所學所得的能力，從而確定進修和晉階的起點，減少在這些技能方面重複受訓的需要。\nRecognition of Prior Learning (RPL) mechanism under the Qualifications Framework (QF) enables practitioners of various backgrounds to receive formal recognition of their knowledge, skills and experience already acquired. It facilitates practitioners with learning aspirations to have the opportunity to evaluate their prior competencies acquired through experience or previous training in the industry, so that they can determine their strategy to pursue further education by gaining access to academic credit, and decrease duplication of learning for the same skills.\n過往資歷認可機制 RPL Mechanism\n過往資歷認可機制將以行業所訂的《能力標準說明》為基礎，以確保其認受性。過往資歷認可將以能力單元組合形式進行，能力單元組合會列明從業員職能所涵蓋的能力，並列明各資歷級別所需要的行業工作年資及相關工作經驗要求，供從業員參考。從業員可以根據其能力申請認可。\nThe RPL mechanism will operate based on the Specification of Competency Standards (SCSs) formulated by the respective industries to ensure its credibility. The RPL mechanism will be conducted in form of clusters. Each cluster will construe the competency requirements in job types, years of working experience and relevant experience for practitioners' reference. Practitioners can apply for RPL according to their own competency standards.\n能力標準說明 Specification of Competency Standards (SCSs)\n能力標準說明詳情，請按此連結:\nhttps://www.hkqf.gov.hk/ie/tc/scs/introduction/index.html\nFor details of Specification of Competency Standards (SCS), please visit:\nhttps://www.hkqf.gov.hk/ie/en/scs/introduction/index.html",

  "text": "In response to the complex challenges faced by the port sector and the related shipping and logistics industries, the Global Port Research Alliance (GPRA) has been formed among leading universities in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The main objective of GPRA is to establish a global research and teaching platform for port operations, maritime and transport logistics by building collaborative arrangements among GPRA members, as well as between GPRA and the industry.\nThe first GPRA meeting was held in 2014 at the University of Sydney. Holding the GPRA 2015 in Hong Kong will provide alliance members with an opportunity to look more closely at Hong Kong. Hong Kong is strategically located in the world's major trade routes. Handling over 20 million TEUs annually, the port of Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world. The port also provides hundreds of weekly container-liner shipping services connecting to global cargo origins and destinations.\nGPRA 2015 is an excellent platform to enhance collaboration between academic researchers to generate possible solutions to address current and emerging shipping and port related issues. It also provides opportunities for multi-stakeholder dialogue to develop creative methods to tackle unresolved challenges in port operations and management.\nContributions are invited on topics within the conference scope and other relevant topics.\nFull Papers\nFull papers may be submitted for consideration for inclusion in the conference proceedings, following peer-review by referees.\nPlease click here to download the information for author.\nShort Papers\nAuthors may submit short papers for presentation. In this case, short papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract (from one to four pages) summarizing the content of the presentation.\nPresentation at the Conference\nAll papers (both full and short tracks) will be accompanied by an oral presentation (15 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions) or a poster presentation.\nPublication in Special Issues\nAuthors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for publication in scholarly journals.\nAbout Hong Kong\nThe Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is an important regional passenger hub and gateway for worldwide destinations. About 90 airlines operate to and from the airport across the globe. HKIA handles more than 50 million passengers annually and ranks as one of the top ten busiest airports worldwide by passenger traffic. HKIA is also the world's business airport by cargo traffic.\nThe campus of PolyU is strategically located at the centre of the city of Hong Kong. The campus is easily accessible by various means of public transport. The main campus is also linked with a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station by covered footbridges. Attendees may also stay in other hotels close to railway stations.\nGPRA 2015 will be held in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, the famous \"Pearl of the Orient\", is situated in South China enclosed by the Pearl River Delta. Examples of popular attractions in the city for world travellers to visit include, but not limited to, the Avenue of Stars, Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, and Temple Street Night Market. The heart of Hong Kong is the Victoria Harbour. The \"Symphony of Lights', featuring more than 40 buildings on both sides of the harbour, has been named as the \"World's Largest Permanent Light and Sound Show\" by the Guinness Book of World Records.\nFor further travel information about Hong Kong, please visit Hong Kong Tourism Board's website: www.discoverhongkong.com.\n(Source: Hong Kong Tourism Board)\nHotel Accommodation\nGPRA2015 has made an agreement with hotels near the conference venue, offering special rates to GPRA 2015 participants.\nHotel Icon\nNo. 17, Science Museum Road, Tsim Sha Tsui East, Kowloon, Hong Kong (location map)\nFor more information, please click here.\nSpecial Room Rates for GPRA 2015 Participants:\nRoom Type Room Rate (Per Room Per Night) Remark \nIcon 36 City\tHK$1650*\tRoom Only\t\nIcon 36 Harbour\tHK$1850*\t\n(*plus 10% service charge per room per night, subject to availability)\nFor Reservation, please click Here or quote \"GPRA\" and contact\nTel: 852 3400 1000\nEmail: book@hotel-icon.com\nHarbour Plaza Metropolis\n7 Metropolis Drive, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong (location map)\nFor more information, please click here.\nSpecial Room Rates for GPRA 2015 Participants:\nRoom Type Room Rate (Per Room Per Night) Remark \nSuperior Room\tHK$1000*\tRoom Only\t\n(*Room rates are inclusive of service charge and government tax per room per night)\nReservation Deadline: 30 Apr 2015\nFor Reservation, please download the special Registration Form, and send the completed form via e-mail to the hotel.
