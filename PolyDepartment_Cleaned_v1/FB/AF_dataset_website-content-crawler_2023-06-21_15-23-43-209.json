  "text": "To be successful in the business world, knowledge and techniques are not enough. Soft skills, vision, courage, global views coupled with a proactive attitude are essential.\nThe Professional Mentoring Programme (PMP) is a coaching and counseling programme organized by the School of Accounting and Finance for accounting and finance undergraduate students who will proceed to their final year of study in next year. It is designed to embrace the building up of a mentor-protégé relationship between students and individual working professionals and industry leaders. Its goal is to enhance the future professional and career development of students under the guidance and advice of their mentors.\nPMP is recognized as one of the School’s many co-curricular activities. The specific objectives of the Programme are:\nTo facilitate the educational, social and personal growth of mentees;\nTo develop mentees’ fullest potential, vision and aspirations for the future;\nTo enhance mentees’ future professional and career development;\nTo help groom mentees to become preferred graduates; and\nTo empower mentees to face challenges in society.\nThe mentors are appointed on an honorary basis. They are experienced alumni and professional members working in CPA firms, banks, commerce, industries and government organizations. A mentor normally takes care of one to two mentees. The mentoring period of the PMP lasts for one and a half years. During the mentoring period, mentor and mentees shall meet on dates, times and places which are convenient to both parties. The meetings can be lunch or dinner meetings, workplace visits in the mentor’s office, and University campus visits and meetings. Mentees can also invite mentors to attend University functions, which are conducive to the development of an effective mentor-mentee relationship. The primary objective is to establish and maintain a close relationship between the mentor and the mentees.\nThe mentor-mentee meetings provide opportunities for the mentors to share their working experience and visions in career and professional development with their mentees. It is hoped that through this mentoring programme, the mentees will widen their horizon and be more prepared to work in the real world before graduation.",

I am currently an Assistant Professor in Accounting at Hong Kong Baptist University. During my PhD programme, I was trained in a world-class research environment, with comprehensive coursework, adequate stipend, supportive supervisors, access to many databases, as well as extensive exposure to PhD workshops and research seminars delivered by renowned scholars from all over the world. The professors in the School of Accounting and Finance were productive and willing to guide PhD students. In the 5th year of my study, I published a paper titled “Policy uncertainty and loan loss provisions in the banking industry” in the Review of Accounting Studies together with Professors Jeffrey Ng and Walid Saffar. Life at PolyU was more than just academic pursuit. Playing basketball and hiking around Hong Kong were some of my favourite pastimes.”\nJanus Zhang, PhD graduate (2020)\n“I enrolled in the PhD programme at the School of Accounting and Finance in 2017. I will graduate in June 2021 and join Central University of Finance and Economics as an assistant professor. I have received high-quality academic training from PhD coursework, PhD workshops, and research seminars. The School of Accounting and Finance is one big family and I have enjoyed my PhD life here. Our professors are very kind and willing to offer suggestions or work with PhD students on research projects. In 2021, I published, together with my professors, two papers, “Talk less, learn more: Strategic disclosure in response to managerial learning from the options market” in the Journal of Accounting Research and “CEO early-life disaster experience and stock price crash risk” in the Journal of Corporate Finance.

  "text": "Editorial Policy\nThe Asia-Pacific Journal of Taxation (APJT) publishes research papers, commentary notes, book reviews and article abstracts that address significant issues in the field of taxation of relevance to Hong Kong, China and the Asia-Pacific region. \nResearch papers should be analytical, which either be empirically or theoretically based. Studies of comparative practices or international research reports in the field of taxation are encouraged.\nEditorial Procedures\nAuthors should submit their manuscripts to the Joint Editors of APJT.\nWork submitted for consideration must be original and unpublished, and not under consideration for publication elsewhere.\nManuscripts submitted to APJT will be reviewed by the Joint Editors for general suitability for publication. Those considered appropriate will be sent to two reviewers for evaluation using a double blind review procedure. Based on the recommendations of the reviewers, the Joint Editors will then decide whether the particular article should be accepted as it is (and the publication schedule), revised or rejected. The process so described is a general one. The Joint Editors, however, may, in some circumstances, vary this process at their discretion.\nNon-exclusive License of the Article\nBy submitting your article to APJT, you hereby agree to give to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Taxation Institute of Hong Kong (the “Publishers”) the right to be the first publisher of the your article in any part of the world, in any language, in print and electronic forms, to take effect if and when the said article is accepted for publication.\nAfter first publication in print and electronic forms, the Publishers will have an ongoing but non-exclusive license to publish and republish the said article in any part of the world, in any language, in print and electronic forms in APJT, and anthologies derived from APJT.\nGuidelines for Manuscripts\nAll manuscripts are to be typewritten double spaced on one side (international-size A4 preferred; North American 8” x 11” letter size also acceptable). Margins should be about 25 mm or 1 inch to facilitate editing and duplication.\nCover page — The cover page should include the title of the manuscript, the name, title, affiliation, address, phone and fax number of each author, and any acknowledgement of financial, technical and other assistance.\nAbstract page — The abstract page should have the title of the manuscript and a 100–150 words abstract but should not identify the author(s).\nText — Begin the text on a new page with the title but without the name of the author(s). Headings should be bold-faced, entirely in upper case while subheadings within the main headings should be bold-faced, in upper and lower cases. Footnotes, if unavoidable, should be kept to a minimum. They should be numbered consecutively throughout the manuscript, typed with double-spacing and collected on a separate page with the heading “Endnotes”. The endnotes should follow the last page of the text. Reference citations within the text should consist of the cited author’s last name and the year of publication, enclosed in parentheses, for example: (Alm 1991), or (Brent, Morse and Stice 1990). If the author’s name appears in the sentence, only the year of publication should be in parentheses, for example: as discussed by Brent, Morse and Stice (1990). References to multiple works should occur within one set of parentheses, separated by semi-colons, for example: (Alm 1991; Brent, Morse and Stice 1990; and Lewellen and Mauer 1988).\nReferences — References should be listed on a separate, double spaced page. This listing should only contain those references cited in the text of the manuscript. References are listed in alphabetical order by the first author’s last name.\nSamples of entries are as follows:\nAlm, James (1991), “A Perspective on the Experimental Analysis of Taxpayer Reporting”, The Accounting Review, July, pp. 577–593.\nBrent, Averil, Morse, Dale and Stice, E.K. (1990), “Short Interest: Explanations and Tests”, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, June, pp. 273–289.\nHalkyard, Andrew and Vanderwolk, J.P. (1993), Hong Kong\nTax Law—Cases and Materials, Butterworths Asia.\nLewellen, W.G. and Mauer, D.C. (1988), “Tax Options and Corporate Capital Structures”, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, December, pp. 387–400.\nUpon acceptance of a paper for publication, the author(s) will be requested to submit a carefully-edited version of the manuscript. The author(s) will be required to sign a publication agreement with APJT. Author(s) of accepted manuscripts will be provided with proof copies of their articles for proofreading. Neither the Joint Editors nor APJT will accept responsibility for errors, omissions, loss or damage to manuscripts..\nVol. 25 No. 2 - 2021\nHK Technical Column\nA Review of Recent Board of Review Cases\nPercy Wong & Jody Wong\nTrajectories for the Development of the Inland Revenue Ordinance in Hong Kong\nStefano Mariani\nCharities and Taxation - Updates\nPhilip Hung & Felix Tsang\nPRC & International Technical Column\nChina tax policies in the Greater Bay Area – a new landscape and prospect \nRebecca Wong & Cherie Li\n海南自貿港税收政策解讀\n李雁 & 劉昭華 & 路遙 & 胡音\nArticle of Interest\nBelt & Road Column\nPhilippines – Changing the Tax Landscape\nMaria Carmela M.

  "text": "The School of Accounting and Finance has long been established as a leading provider of tertiary education in accounting. The incorporation of the three disciplines—economics, finance and law—into the School in 2003 made it truly an interdisciplinary family. To uphold the Faculty's pursuit of \"IDEAS\" (Innovation-driven Education and Scholarship), and committed to the University's pledge of \"Opening Minds • Shaping the Future\", the School offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that incorporate recent frontier research findings and professional competency. In addition to the traditional programme—Bachelor of Business Administration in Accountancy, we have expanded our undergraduate curricula with Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting and Finance and Bachelor of Business Administration in Financial Services. These programmes continuously attract the most intelligent and diligent students locally, from the Mainland, and overseas.\nStarting with the new cohort of 2022/23, all students of the Bachelor of Business Administration programmes will be admitted to their respective departments first without declaring their majors, which will be selected in the second year. Our goal is to broaden our students' learning experience and help them identify their interests before receiving in-depth education in their major area of study.\nNot only is our School the first of its kind in Hong Kong, but it is also perhaps the largest academic unit in the world in terms of the number of faculty members and student population. Having about 90 full-time teaching staff, we have built up a critical mass of specialists in key disciplines, such as financial accounting, management accounting, finance, auditing, taxation, business law, economics, corporate governance, and accounting information systems. The highly qualified and diverse backgrounds of our faculty members also help advance our interdisciplinary approach to teaching, research, and consultancy within and outside the School.\nBuilding on the strength of our interdisciplinary staff, the School offers taught postgraduate programmes, including Master of Science in Accounting and Finance Analytics, Master of Science in Accountancy, Master of Corporate Finance, Master of Finance, Master of Corporate Governance, and Master of Professional Accounting. In addition, we offer two research programmes, namely Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy. Our staff have constantly embraced the spirit of change to adapt to the ever-developing macro- and micro-economic environment with a positive frame of mind. With solidarity and teamwork, the School is committed to enhancing research innovations and bringing excellent teaching into the classroom, \"Where New Thinking Creates Business Opportunities\".",

  "text": "(10 May 2023) The Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s (PolyU) School of Accounting and Finance, in collaboration with AI stock investment app Asklora, released the 2023 first-half Fintech Adoption Index (FAI) report. It aims to measure the latest condition and barriers of consumer fintech adoption and provide recommendations to fintech suppliers and policymakers to improve financial inclusion in Hong Kong.\nOn 25 Apr, The FAI released its 2023 semi-annual report. Ir. Prof. T.C. Edwin Cheng, Dean of PolyU Business School and King Leung, Head of Fintech at InvestHK, attended the FAI release event with several fintech leaders and representatives from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Consumer Council. \nThe FAI surveyed over 2,000 Hong Kong residents on their adoption of key fintech applications divided into five fintech segments: digital payment (DP), virtual bank (VB), virtual insurance (VI), virtual wealth (VW), and virtual assets (VA). \nThe survey found that 74% of all respondents were users of at least two fintech segments, with digital payment leading the way with a 91% adoption rate. The three most commonly adopted fintech segments are digital payment, virtual banks, and virtual wealth. \nFurther analysis showed that fintech adoption in Hong Kong was higher among users between their 30s and 50s than younger Gen Z users. Additionally, our survey showed that fintech adoption was skewed toward males and users with higher education and higher income. Property ownership was positively correlated to fintech adoption. Gabriel Kung, Chief Commercial Officer of Bowtie, a virtual insurance company, said, “Data from the FAI report provided insightful information for the virtual insurance industry. looking ahead to the future, Bowtie will further improve our online insurance platform in order to offer a convenient yet reliable online insuring experience to citizens.”\nIn fact, the FAI data provides pragmatic marketing strategies for other fintech startups, such as Asklora, an AI-based stock investment platform that is an FAI collaborator and supporter. Stephen Joon CHOI, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Asklora, said, “Asklora has shifted its focus from younger, inexperienced investors to a slightly older and wealthier target audience based on the FAI report.” The survey also revealed a need for Chinese language educational services on fintech to address a potentially underserved population.\nWhile there is a great success in Hong Kong fintech adoption, the average fintech adoption across all segments is 54%, which indicates a bifurcation: certain segments, such as digital payments, are a resounding success, but others, such as virtual assets, have yet to take true acceptance. The FAI survey asked non-adopting participants why they chose not to use the fintech services. The top two answers were satisfaction with existing services and distrust of new technology. With the upcoming SFC licensing regime on virtual assets, virtual assets may exhibit the highest user growth in the coming months. \nIn the future, the PolyU-Asklora FAI survey plans to incorporate areas related to behavioral finance, investment and retirement options for consumers, enablers for small-medium enterprises, aspects of fintech usage, and the challenges and opportunities for fintech providers from a user perspective in future research. \nThe PolyU-Asklora FAI project is led by Dr. Jingran ZHAO, Associate Professor of the School of Accounting and Finance of PolyU, Jack POON, Professor of Practice from the same school, and Stephen Joon CHOI, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Asklora.\nFor more information on the PolyU-Asklora FAI, please visit https://www.polyufai.org.",

Raman (The University of Texas at San Antonio) and Byongwook (Brian) Yun (University of Missouri)\nAbstract:\nWe examine the impact of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) international inspection program on US companies’ exports. Our difference-in-difference analyses suggest that following the initial PCAOB international inspection in a country abroad, US companies experienced an increase in exports to (but not imports from) that country. We also find that following the initial PCAOB international inspection in a country abroad, companies in that country report higher accounts payable, consistent with the initial PCAOB inspection facilitating trade credit financing. The effect on US companies’ exports is stronger for industries requiring more relationship-specific investments and for countries with less ex-ante transparency, weak auditor oversight, low social trust, and low trade network centrality. Collectively, our findings suggest that the initial PCAOB inspection in a country, by increasing the quality/comparability of financial reporting in that country is followed by an increase in US companies’ exports. Our findings complement prior research on the PCAOB international inspection program which to date has focused exclusively on non-US companies, by identifying a positive externality (unintended benefit) for US companies from the initial PCAOB international inspections.",

  "text": "“Economic sustainability” and “entrepreneurial finance” are inter-related areas that have drawn considerable attention from the government and policy makers, practitioners and academics. The term “sustainability” refers to the long-term maintenance of systems based on economic, environmental, and social considerations (the so called ‘triple bottom line’). A narrow definition of economic sustainability focuses on the sustainable growth of the firms. This includes strategies which, for example, lead to a long-term rise in the share price, revenues and market share rather than short-term explosions of profits at the expense of long-term viability of success. A broader concept of economic sustainability would include the company’s attitude towards and impact upon the economic framework in which it is embedded. Frauds, bribery, or cartels, for instance, could be regarded as economically unsustainable because these activities undermine the long-term functioning of markets.\nOn the other hand, the role of finance in supporting the growth of the firms is well established. Other than providing financial support, the financiers’ funding decisions provide crucial feedback on innovations and direct a society’s entrepreneurial efforts. ‘Entrepreneurial finance’ is the study of value and resource allocation to new ventures who are propellants of innovation. In the narrow sense, it studies the role of specialized financiers (such as angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity) in selecting and coaching entrepreneurial firms. In a broader sense, it also embraces financial innovations in association with information technology advancement. These financial innovations (such as new payment methods, P2P finance, crowdinvesting, etc.) combine the digital savvy and let’s-disrupt-something attitude of start-ups, the social mission of microfinance and financial inclusion, and insights from behavioral economics and human-centred design. Entrepreneurial finance creates new opportunities and threats for financial service providers, and promises radically different and better products tailored to individual needs and characterized by higher quality, lower cost, and unheard-of convenience.\nEntrepreneurial finance and economic sustainability are closely connected. Only when an entrepreneurial firm is “sustainable” economically, socially and environmentally and in governance can it provide stable returns to its financiers. In the past decade, socially responsible investment (SRI), which represents an investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards into consideration, has become the most vibrant area in the global investment industry. According to a Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) report based on a survey of the world’s largest 17 private equity firms, 94% of their general partners agree that ESG are important indicators for firm vale, and they will enhance the proportion of SRI in their portfolios in the next five years.\nThe above new trends and connections all require scholarly understanding, and research output in economic sustainability and entrepreneurial finance will be of substantial interest to financial institutions, policy makers, regulators, and businesses. The School of Accounting and Finance (AF) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University recognizes this opportunity and proposes to establish the Centre for Economic Sustainability and Entrepreneurial Finance (CESEF), which will act as a platform for pooling the school’s inter-disciplinary research strengths, as well as its strong partnership with the industry (details below), to generate strong research impact in the Greater China region.",

  "text": "Mr Melvin AU Yin Chung, a current student of the Master of Design (Design Strategies) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, has won the new logo design competition held by the Center for Economic Sustainability and Entrepreneurial Finance (CESEF). The new visual identity highly reflects the Center’s objective and aspiration.\nMelvin had submitted two separate entries to the competition and the second one caught the panel’s eye. The first draft was his first attempt to represent CESEF’s vision in a logo. After fine-tuning the first design repeatedly, he eventually came across the idea of the second design that won this competition.\nThe new logo designed for the Center for Economic Sustainability and Entrepreneurial Finance (CESEF) is formed of the five-letter abbreviation “CESEF”, where the letter E (E for both “Economic” and “Entrepreneurial”) is placed on the left, colored in blue; F and S are on the right and colored in green. The letter C is just hidden in the negative space between the strokes of the letter E. Meanwhile, all colored geometric planes constitute a big Chinese character “可” —the first character of CESEF in Chinese. Both the first Chinese character and English abbreviation of the Center are manifested in just one simple logo.\nThe final product was developed through numerous attempts and by trial and error. Melvin admitted that the inspiration of using the Chinese character “可” came to him suddenly at the last minute during his 2-week creation period. “It was as if I was struck by a brainwave”, Melvin recalled when asked about the design process. The incorporation of both Chinese and English characters into one logo is an innovative approach to logo design, which emphasizes the bilingual feature of the organization.\nMelvin also talked about the difficulties he encountered while designing the logo. As the Center’s full name is too long, which certainly affects the design visibility, he put a lot of effort in producing the clearest and user-friendly logo. In addition, it was hard to correlate the concepts of “economic sustainability” and “entrepreneurial finance” with relevant graphic symbols.\nAs for the use of color, he utilized two colors, dark blue and green, for the logo. He chose these two colors because they resemble the color tones of the original logo, only that they are in a darker shade. “The new logo is a continuation of the previous logo, and symbolizes the gradual evolution of CESEF into a more mature and well-developed organization. The logo appears more conspicuous and professional”, Melvin said.\nLogo Designer Bio\nMelvin Au Yin Chung is a designer in Hong Kong, mainly focusing on user experience, visual communication, and media art. Currently he is a student of Master of Design (Design Strategies) at PolyU in Hong Kong.",

  "text": "2020-04-28\nKT Webinar: COVID-19 and negative oil prices: Does this mean oil is free now? \nWe have invited eminent international energy economist Prof. James L. Smith to share with us on the very timely topic and unprecedented phenomenon of negative oil prices. This talk gives an overview of what negative prices mean for the oil market, how we got to this point, and the roles played by COVID-19 and OPEC.\nPresentation material: COVID-19 and negative oil prices: Does this mean oil is free now?\n——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–\n——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–\n2019-06-25: Knowledge Transfer Forum on ESG Integration\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are keys to companies’ sustainable development and should be taken into consideration by investors when screening potential investments, according to experts at a symposium themed “ESG Investment Engagement: The Perspective of Participating CEOs”, held by the Faculty of Business and the Center for Economic Sustainability and Entrepreneurial Finance (CESEF) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) on 25 June 2019.\nLouis Cheng, Professor of Finance at PolyU’s School of Accounting and Finance and Director of CESEF, pointed out in the opening speech, that the event was aimed at improving awareness of ESG factors among companies and investors. Since 2015, ESG investing has become very popular. ESG is related to how a company performs as a steward of nature, how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates, and how it deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.\nCheng elaborated that companies adopting ESG approach would make a happier and greener society and improve shareholder value, and ESG standards are attached to a goal which is to make sustainable investing so people who are involved in the supply chain of investment should think highly of ESG factors. “Whoever cares about the society actually makes more money,” he stressed the importance of ESG criteria by addressing the idea from a report called Who Cares Wins done by a joint initiative of financial institutions invited by previous United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to develop guidelines and recommendations on how to better integrate environmental, social and corporate governance issues in asset management, securities brokerage services and associated research functions.\nCheng added that the implementation of ESG and green finance would help companies to improve ratings by commercial data providers including Bloomberg, Morningstar and MSCI. The difference between ESG Investing and Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) was also elaborated by Cheng. He said that SRI is more related to factors including religious concerns and ethical principles, and each SRI portfolio could be independent, while ESG standards are more focused on long-term sustainability.\nMr. Simon Mak, CEO at Friends of the Earth (HK), one of Hong Kong‘s most prominent green groups, emphasized the importance of adopting ESG standards, mentioning that finance is a crucial element of driving other initiatives within the economic system and green finance approach is necessary for ensuring sustainable development. Mak said their organization has been promoting environmental philosophy through policy advocacy, corporate partnership and community engagement, and they focus on five subjects — climate and energy, waste, land use, urban forestry and green finance.\nFriends of the Earth (HK), established in 1983 as a charitable organization, is a leading environmental advocate in Hong Kong and the organization has been committed to cooperating with the government, businesses and the community to create sustainable policies, business practices and community lifestyles over the past 35 years. Currently it has a membership of more than 15,000 individuals and 30 corporates. Dr. Ricky Szeto, Executive Director of Hung Fook Tong Group Holdings Limited, emphasized corporate social responsibility (CSR) and creating shared value (CSV) based on the company’s own strategies. He said that he had witnessed improvement in public awareness of CSR. Companies have been evolving from previously being defensive, charitable and promotional into the present stage of focusing on sustainable development of companies and society. Szeto believed that companies should pay more attention to such areas as corporate governance, risk management, sustainable development, green economy, company reputation and corporate culture. In terms of ESG report, he said it is critical to be factual, quantitative, consistent and balanced.\nAt the forum, Prof. Cheng announced CESEF’s collaboration with Friends of the Earth (HK) and Hung Fook Tong to set up “ESG Investment Education Pledge”, with the latter two parties setting aside funding within their corporate accounts up to HK$ 10 million and HK$ 2 million respectively. The pledge provides research opportunity for PolyU students to analyze ESG performance of listed firms in Hong Kong and Mainland. The research findings will be considered and adopted (if appropriate) for ESG Investment of these two organizations using the funding pledged. This initiative aims to push for sustainability through ESG investments using research from PolyU students as part of their investment processes. Such a pledge will help the School of Accounting and Finance at PolyU to educate its students about ESG and its importance, according to Cheng. Students of its Master’s programme in Financial Economics in Energy and Environment will have the opportunity to participate in research supported by the ESG Investment Education Pledge and launch their careers as specialists in one of the fastest growing niche areas in the financial industry after graduation.\nMaster of Finance (Financial Economics in Energy and Environment) at PolyU has been designed for degree graduates with no or little work experience to specialize in the energy and environment areas of the financial industry. The curriculum, built on solid economic and finance foundation, has incorporated up-to-date industry practices for a unique synthesis of theories and applications. As a participant of the CFA Institute University Affiliation Program, this master’s degree prepares students to sit Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®) examination.

The symposium also invited Dr David Broadstock , Assistant Professor in PolyU’s School of Accounting and Finance and CESEF Deputy Director (Economics); Dr Eva Chan, Chairman of Hong Kong Investor Relations Association; Dr Eric Chiang, Executive Director of Investment Management Division at Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC; Dr Charles Lam, Managing Director of Real Estate at Baring Private Equity Asia; Dr Julia Wang, President at Peter F.

We posit that the managerial incentives regarding the cost strategy and sustainability performance strategy are interdependent. To create firm value, management has incentives to adopt cost management practices which align the cost stickiness strategy with economic sustainability performance (ESP) and with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sustainability performance. Using a sample of 5,565 firm-year observations during 1992-2013, we find that a firm’s level of cost stickiness is positively associated with both its ESP and ESG sustainability performance. Moreover, we find that the association between a firm’s level of cost stickiness and ESP is moderated by ESG sustainability performance. Finally, we find that the relation between cost stickiness and ESG sustainability performance is more pronounced for governance and social dimensions of non-financial sustainability performance. The results are consistent with the view that management tends to retain scarce resources when expecting improvements in overall sustainability performance. Our results present new evidence to understand how management integrates cost management strategies with various dimensions of sustainability performance decisions and thus provide policy, practical, and research implications.\n——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–\nTrack Record of the School of Accounting and Finance in Energy Economics and Sustainability\nOther useful links for energy and environment-related finance, economics, accounting and law",

  "text": "Overview of Green Finance and ESG presentation materials in PASS seminars and conferences\nDuring 2019, we have organized several seminars and one conference for our PASS project “Educating Accounting Professionals on How to Adopt Green Finance in Capital Projects“. To help readers to better search for materials, we re-group the presentation materials into several clusters for your selection. For each cluster, we provide an introduction to help you to understand the key elements in each category. We need to thank all the presenters in contributing their valuable resources and time to provide the presentation materials for the event participants and public for a free-down load. We sincerely hope that you will find these materials useful.\nCluster 1: Green Finance \nOverview of Green Finance cluster\nThe Green Finance cluster has sections. Section A (GF.A) has two presentation files. Jonathan Drew from HSBC and Hannah Routh from Deloitte China provide a basic understanding of green finance. Both Jonathan and Hannah are passionate about the saving the planet by utilizing the green power of money. First, Jonathan reviews the carbon dioxide issue and the investment scope of green bonds. Then Hannah explains the climate issues under the ESG integration framework and the roles of various green organizations including the HKGFA, FSDC, and TCFD. This set of materials allow you to understand climate issues and green finance from the perspectives of an investment banker and a Big4 partner.\nSection B (GF.B) has three presentation materials. This set evolves around the theme of green buildings. We have presenters from three well-known property developers in Hong Kong. They are Ellie Tang from New World Development, Kevin Ng from Henderson Land, and Raymond Yau from Swire Properties. Each of the presenters showcase their own green buildings and the challenges involved. Readers can learn about green buildings in Hong Kong and some technical details on to measure greenness for buildings. In addition, environmental and financial benefits of green buildings are also being discussed. For readers who are in the accounting profession, you may find these materials on green capital projects very refreshing and interesting.\nSection A (GF.A): Green Finance\nJonathan Drew (HSBC): Green Finance and Green Bond: An Investment Banker’s Perspective\nHannah Routh (Deloitte China): Green Finance and Climate Change – Risks and Opportunities\nSection B (GF.B): Green Building\nEllie Tang (New World Development): Green Building: Approach, Challenges & Opportunities\nKevin Ng (Henderson Land Development): Green Building: Challenges and Opportunities\nRaymond Yau (Swire Properties): Green Building: Challenges and Opportunities\nCluster 2: ESG1\nOverview of ESG1 cluster\nThere are two sections in this cluster. Section A (ESG1.A) focuses on ESG integration by renowned asset management executives and professionals including Victoria Mio from Robeco, Jean-Louis Nakamura and Odile Lange-Broussy from Lombard Odier, and Stephen Andrews from BlackRock. First, Louis Cheng, Director of CESEF Center at PolyU and PASS project coordinator gives an overview on the dynamic relationship between green bonds and ESG integration, and the challenges in achieving sustainability through benchmarking. Then each of the industry speakers provides a pragmatic discussion on how their firms pursue ESG integration. The readers will be benefited by these presentation materials in terms of knowing the unique approach and methodology used by these firms in achieving ESG integration. You will also realize that even ESG is the governing framework, the emphasis of sub-factors in the areas of E, S, and G vary substantially among these firms, making it very informative for practitioners to choose their own preference towards environmental, social or governance in achieving financial returns.\nSection B of this cluster consists of a wonderful collection of materials on market development of green finance and ESG in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Louis Cheng from PolyU, Stephen Wong from OHKF, and Peiyuan Guo from Syntao Green Finance provide the latest development in terms of market conditions, regulatory challenges, industry concerns and the way forward for the future development. For readers who are interested in general information about the market and opinion from industry professionals, this set of materials will be valuable for their learning.\nSection A (ESG1.A): ESG Integration for Investments\nLouis Cheng (PolyU): ESG: The Path to Sustainable Investment\nVictoria Mio (Robeco Hong Kong Limited): ESG Integration for Investment Portfolio\nJean-Louis Nakamura (Lombard Odier Group): Sustainability at the Heart of Investing\nOdile Lange-Broussy (Lombard Odier (Singapore) Ltd.): Analyzing ESG Data: An Investment Perspective\nStephen Andrews (BlackRock): ESG Investing at BlackRock\nSection B (ESG1.B): Market Development and Industry Analysis\nLouis Cheng (PolyU): ESG Integration: Focus Group Report 2019\nStephen Wong (Our Hong Kong Foundation): Green Finance and ESG Integration: A Hong Kong Policy Perspective\nGuo Peiyuan (SynTao): Green Finance and ESG Development in China\nCluster 3: ESG 2\nOverview of ESG2 cluster\nThe final cluster consists of 3 separate sections. The first section (ESG2.A) showcases various methodologies for ESG evaluation from data providers and rating agencies including MSCI, Morningstar (Sustainanalytics), and S&P Global Ratings. In addition, Louis Cheng and David Broadstock from PolyU provide interesting findings on certain concerns and misinformation from listed firms’ ESG reports as well as unique features and differences of various ESG data available in the market. Section B (ESG2.B) contains a collection of presentation materials on analytics of ESG reports from the Big4 consulting units and from a former HSBC executive. Finally, in order to learn about ESG reporting, we should hear from listed firm executives on how they prepare for the report and challenges they face. Therefore, in section C (ESG2.C), we are proud to have four distinguish listed firms to share with us on this topic. They are Kit Law from CLP Group, Ricky Szeto from Hung Fook Tong, Guy Look from Sa Sa and Suki Wong from Anta. These materials should be valuable for readers who want to see the mechanism and process of producing ESG reports.\nSection A (ESG2.A): ESG Data Analytics\nLouis Cheng (PolyU): Areas of Concerns and Misunderstanding in ESG Reporting: The Case of Hong Kong Listed Firms\nChris Tse (MSCI): ESG Investing: for Asset Owners who Seek to Integrate ESG\nLiz Peng (Morningstar): Methodological Approach for ESG Analysis\nGloria Lu (S&P Global Ratings): Evaluating ESG Performance of Companies\nDavid Broadstock (PolyU): Understanding ESG Data: Data for ESG Investment – HK + Connect in Focus\nSection B (ESG2.B): ESG Reporting\nRobert Milners (PricewaterhouseCoopers): Challenges in Collecting Non-financial Data\nDerek Yuen (KPMG): ESG Reporting\nBrian Ho (EY): How to Move Beyond Compliance in Sustainability Reporting?\nHugh Pye (HSBC Holdings plc): Sustainability and Reporting – the View from Europe\nSection C (ESG2.C): Case Studies\nKit Law (CLP Group): Case Study: CLP Group\nRicky Szeto (Hung Fook Tong Group Holdings Limited): Case Study: Hung Fook Tong Group Holdings Limited\nGuy Look (Sa sa International Holdings Limited): Case Study: Sa Sa International Holdings Limited\nSuki Wong (Anta Sports Products Limited): Anta ESG Integration\n_________________\nThis material/event is funded by the Professional Services Advancement Support Scheme of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\nAny opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material/any event organised under this project do not reflect the views of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or the Vetting Committee of the Professional Services Advancement Support Scheme.",

The ultimate goal is to advocate institutional investors to adopt ESG/SRI principles such as the SFC’s Principles of Responsible Ownership or principles of higher standard. The program will first involve focus groups to gather knowledge and wisdom. Next, we will jointly produce a summary report from the findings of the focus groups to disseminate our findings to the stakeholders and the public.\nFinal Report: FoE (HK) Focus Group Report 2019\nThe Voice-over Script for Presentation\nFocus Group Topic:\nWhat are the main challenges faced by asset owners and managers to execute ESG investment strategies\nIndustry Support for the ESG initiative:\nWe have received support from the following organizations to participate in our focus groups:\nCFA Institute/Hong Kong Society of Financial Analyst (HKSFA) – CFA Institute is the premier global association for investment management professional.

  "text": "ESG COVID-19 Report is available to download:\nEnglish Version\nChinese Version\nAbstract\nWe examine two ESG-related investment issues. First, using industry neutral, bi-annually re-balanced portfolios constructed by ESG scores, we track ESG-tilted investment portfolio performance for the CSI300 constituent stocks during 2015-2020. The differential cumulative return for the high ESG vs the low ESG group is about 12.83% during the July 2017-December 2019 period, and for the whole sample is 9.4%. These figures imply that, even in normal times, an industry neutral ESG based investment strategy allows an investor to earn substantially higher returns in the Chinese market. Second, we explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the stock price performance. Based on a short-term event window, there exhibits a positive relationship between stock returns and ESG ratings during COVID-19 outbreak. This implies that, although China is in the early stage of ESG investing and a lot of investors are ‘unsophisticated’ retail investors, there are preferences for high ESG firms, especially during the crisis period.",

  "text": "Drucker Academy-PolyU Partnership for ESG Entrepreneurship and MLA Leadership\nPeter F. Drucker Academy Hong Kong (wholly owned by MLA Foundation) and PolyU CESEF Center work together to form a partnership to explore the possible integration between ESG and MLA (Management as a Liberal Art) concepts.\nThe partnership program is to promote the understanding and application of how MLA Leadership concepts can be integrated into ESG entrepreneurship. The current problem of ESG integration is a lack of clear road map to integrate social and financial return to implement ESG initiatives. We believe that MLA leadership practice is able to provide a CSR framework to understand social return from the management’s perspective. The goal is to advocate companies and NGOs to adopt Drucker’s management principles by combing social return and financial return to implement ESG initiatives. ESG is a more concrete way to achieve business sustainability, which is in line with the philosophy of MLA leadership and Drucker’s idea of management as a liberal art. Such a MLA framework for measuring social return should be instrumental for ESG integration, which is an important objective of CESEF.\nKey deliverables \nThe expected output will focus on identifying challenges and solutions to apply MLA in ESG entrepreneurship. Two roundtables will be organized for managers and executives to gather knowledge and wisdom and one symposium to disseminate findings from roundtables and research conducted.

  "text": "Selected Publications\nl _..Do Prime Brokers Matter in the Search for Informed Hedge Fund Managers? (with George O. Aragon and Ji-Woong Chung), 2022, Management Science, forthcoming.\no Using the setting of funds of hedge funds (FoFs), we show that prime brokers (PBs) facilitate investors' search for informed hedge fund managers. We find that FoFs exhibit PB bias, a disproportionate preference for hedge funds serviced by their connected PBs. This PB bias is stronger when the cost of hedge fund due diligence is higher relative to capital and when the FoF's management firm generates higher prime brokerage fees. PB bias also predicts FoF performance: the highest PB-bias quartile outperforms the rest by 2.08%–2.45% per annum, after adjusting for differences in their risks.\nl _..Timescale Betas and the Cross Section of Equity Returns: Framework, Application, and Implications for Interpreting the Fama-French Factors (with Francis In and Tong Suk Kim), 2017, Journal of Empirical Finance 42, 15-39.\no We show that standard beta pricing models quantify an asset's systematic risk as a weighted combination of a number of different timescale betas. Given this, we develop a wavelet-based framework that examines the cross-sectional pricing implications of isolating these timescale betas. An empirical application to the Fama-French model reveals that the model's well-known empirical success is largely due to the beta components associated with a timescale just short of a business cycle (i.e., wavelet scale 3). This implies that any viable explanation for the success of the Fama-French model that has been applied to the Fama-French factors should apply particularly to the scale 3 components of the factors. We find that a risk-based explanation conforms closely to this implication.\no _Online Appendix\nl Prime Broker-Level Comovement in Hedge Fund Returns: Information or Contagion? (with Ji-Woong Chung), 2016, Review of Financial Studies 29, 3321-3353. \no .We document strong comovement in the returns of hedge funds sharing the same prime broker. This comovement is driven neither by funds in the same family nor in the same style, and it is distinct from market-wide and local comovement. The common information hypothesis attributes this phenomenon to the prime broker providing valuable information to its hedge fund clients. The prime broker-level contagion hypothesis attributes the comovement to the prime broker spreading funding liquidity shocks across its hedge fund clients. We find strong evidence supporting the common information hypothesis, but limited evidence in favor of the prime broker-level contagion hypothesis.\no Online Appendix\nl _..A Longer Look at the Asymmetric Dependence between Hedge Funds and the Equity Markets (with Francis In, Gunky Kim, and Tong Suk Kim), 2010, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 45, 763-789.\no .This paper reexamines, at a range of investment horizons, the asymmetric dependence between hedge fund returns and market returns. Given the current availability of hedge fund data, the joint distribution of longer-horizon returns is extracted from the dynamics of monthly returns using the filtered historical simulation; we then apply the method based on copula theory to uncover the dependence structure therein. While the direction of asymmetry remains unchanged, the magnitude of asymmetry is attenuated considerably as the investment horizon increases. Similar horizon effects also occur on the tail dependence. Our findings suggest that nonlinearity in hedge fund exposure to market risk is more short term in nature, and that hedge funds provide higher benefits of diversification, the longer the horizon.\nSelected Working Papers\nl _..Does Portfolio Disclosure Make Money Smarter? (with Andrew J. Sinclair and Stig J. Xeno), 2021\no .We provide causal evidence that mandatory portfolio disclosure helps investors evaluate and select hedge fund managers. Using a staggered difference-in-differences analysis, we demonstrate that investor capital flows better predict fund performance among funds that publicly disclose their portfolio holdings. Additional cross-sectional analyses suggest that this gain in selection ability varies with the informational value of disclosure. Furthermore, examining investor-level allocations, we find that institutional investors earn higher returns on their allocations to disclosing funds. Overall, these results help contribute to the cost-benefit analysis of mandatory portfolio disclosure.\nClick here for papers on SSRN\nReturn to Main Page.",

  "text": "Media \nMedia Releases \n2 Nov 2022\nResearch & Innovation School of Accounting and Finance \nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s (PolyU) School of Accounting and Finance, in collaboration with AI investment trading start-up Asklora, has released the inaugural PolyU-Asklora Fintech Adoption Index (FAI), which is the first locally developed index to measure Hong Kong consumers’ fintech adoption and impact.\nThe FAI surveyed over 1,000 Hong Kong residents in regard to their adoption of key fintech applications including virtual banking, mobile payments, online brokerage, digital insurance and cryptocurrency. The survey found online stock brokerage has the second-highest adoption rate among all the fintech applications but ranked second-lowest in terms of active usage rate. Conversely, digital insurance has the second-lowest adoption rate while scoring second-highest in active usage. The research also found that users of virtual banking services had a higher overall adoption rate of all kinds of fintech applications. For instance, 77% of them were users of online brokerage services. \nThe PolyU-Asklora project is led by Dr Jingran ZHAO, Associate Professor of the School of Accounting and Finance, Mr Jack POON, Professor of Practice from the same school and Mr Stephen Joon CHOI, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Asklora. Overall, the FAI was measured at 55, which captures both the proportion of respondents adopting fintech products and the spectrum of fintech services they adopted, with 51% of respondents identified as active fintech users. Furthermore, 85% of respondents reported being satisfied with their fintech solutions experience, while security was cited as their biggest concern. \nDr Jingran Zhao said, “The FAI survey results show that Hong Kong residents are keen to adopt fintech products, but fintech companies still have more work to do to convert these new users to active users by, for example, improving the security of their products.”\nMr Jack Poon also remarked, “It takes two to tango. Financial institutions’ fintech offerings, which is the supply-side, does not translate into true adoption until consumers use and benefit from the offering. The FAI measures demand-side adoption by surveying consumers. Understanding the consumer’s adoption friction is an essential step to broadening financial inclusion in Hong Kong.”\nThe FAI is a long-term research project to measure the evolution of Hong Kong fintech adoption through different events and market conditions, and will be released on a quarterly basis. The next release will be in December with an expanded scope and more participants achieved through online and offline surveys.\nFor more information on the PolyU-Asklora FAI, please visit https://www.polyufai.org. \n*****END*****",

First, using industry neutral, bi-annually re-balanced portfolios constructed by ESG scores, we track ESG-tilted investment portfolio performance for the CSI300 constituent stocks during 2015-2020. The differential cumulative return for the high ESG vs the low ESG group is about 12.83% during the July 2017-December 2019 period, and for the whole sample is 9.4%. These figures imply that, even in normal times, an industry neutral ESG based investment strategy allows an investor to earn substantially higher returns in the Chinese market. Second, we explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the stock price performance. Based on a short-term event window, there exhibits a positive relationship between stock returns and ESG ratings during COVID-19 outbreak. This implies that, although China is in the early stage of ESG investing and a lot of investors are ‘unsophisticated’ retail investors, there are preferences for high ESG firms, especially during the crisis period.",

  "text": "Event \nOrganiser\nSummary\nAbstract:\nInformed short sellers can publicly disclose their short theses to circumvent limits to arbitrage by convincing long investors to sell. We study a rising phenomenon whereby short sellers provide quantitative disclosure in the form of target prices and examine whether and how this disclosure strategy is effective. We first document that short sellers’ target prices are informative in predicting future returns in various windows. Then, we demonstrate that the strategy of disclosing target prices is associated with stronger immediate price declines and accelerated price discovery, indicating that this strategy facilitates short sellers’ success. Next, we examine three channels through which disclosing target prices help short sellers more effectively overcome limits to arbitrage. We argue and provide evidence that target price disclosure signals short sellers’ confidence in the quality of their private information, and the reputation and retaliation concerns could make such a signal more credible. In addition, disclosing target prices reduce investors’ processing costs (awareness and acquisition costs) of short theses. Overall, we conclude that providing target prices is an effective strategy for short sellers, contributing to its rising popularity.\nKeynote Speaker",

Using a large sample of IPOs listed in 46 countries, we show that increased private firm disclosure transparency is associated with more underpriced IPOs. We find that the documented relationship is amplified among IPO firms with higher valuation uncertainty and higher costs of information disclosure, while it is mitigated among IPO firms listed in countries with more stringent financial reporting systems and stronger governance mechanisms, and IPO firms backed up by reputable intermediaries. We provide supporting evidence for a causal interpretation of the documented relationship using a simulated instrument approach. Our findings support the view that increased private firm disclosure transparency leads to increased competition for investor capital among issuing firms, forcing IPO firms to offer investors a larger underpricing discount on their stock.\nKeynote Speaker\nProf. Abhinav Goyal\nProfessor of Finance\nBirmingham Business School\nThe University of Birmingham\nView Speaker's Website",

Short (University of Tennessee)\nAbstract\nPrior literature focuses on the relationship between audit committee (AC) characteristics and financial reporting outcomes, yet little is known about the AC appointment process. Using a large dataset of tens of thousands of potential director candidates, we use machine learning to select a director based on the candidate that our models predict to have the strongest future performance. We identify characteristics of actual appointees that appear to be under- or overweighted when compared to machine-selected candidates, which sheds light on potential biases in the AC appointment process. We then demonstrate that these potential biases in appointment have direct effects on the effectiveness of ACs in overseeing financial reporting. We conclude by providing evidence that the probability of a potentially biased appointment is higher when the actual appointee shares previous connections with firm leadership and when average director compensation is lower. Our findings should be of interest to investors advocating for proxy access, to nominating committees tasked with identifying future board members, and to regulators examining the efficacy of the current nomination system.",

Using confidential Census plant-level data, we find that large manufacturing plant openings not only raise the productivity of local plants but also of distant plants hundreds of miles away, which belong to multi-region firms that are exposed to the local productivity spillover through one of their plants. To quantify the significance of plant-level networks for the propagation and amplification of local productivity shocks, we develop and estimate a quantitative spatial model in which plants of multi-region firms are linked through shared knowledge. Counterfactual exercises show that while knowledge sharing through plant-level networks amplifies the aggregate effects of local productivity shocks, it can widen economic disparities between workers and regions in the economy.",

  "text": "Speaker\nDr Timothy Seidel\nOver the past several decades, accounting firms have expanded, and sometimes divested, their consulting practices. Some suggest that the separation of the audit practice from the consulting practice could increase audit firms’ vulnerability to litigation risk and sensitivity to audit client risk. In this study, we examine the influence of an accounting firm’s consulting revenue on its tolerance for audit client risk and the resulting implications for audit markets. We find that accounting firms with a higher (lower) proportion of revenue generated from consulting will be more (less) tolerant of audit clients that exhibit greater financial, audit, or litigation risk. Additional analyses suggest that reduced tolerances for client risk can have a cascading influence on audit quality—risky clients shed by accounting firms with less revenue from consulting services exhibit a higher likelihood of downward auditor switches and lower subsequent audit quality.\nKeynote Speaker",

Using an instrumental variable regression, we show that the negative impact of intraday tracking error on liquidity is causal. We also find that ETF designated market makers (DMMs) reduce their liquidity provision activities in response to larger tracking error. Increasing tracking error presents an opportunity for primary market arbitrageurs but increases the risk of DMMs’ orders being picked off. ETF DMMs go beyond reducing liquidity provision and actively take liquidity from the market on days with ETF primary market arbitrage activity consistent with these days having higher levels of adverse selection risk.",

  "text": "We examine whether securities regulators’ pre-IPO on-site inspection (a form of public enforcement) can help improve the quality of IPOs. Testing this research question is challenging because regulators’ enforcement actions are typically endogenous. We overcome this identification challenge by exploiting a pre-IPO random regulatory inspection program launched in 2014 that aims to improve the disclosure quality of IPO applications. We find that the IPO applicants subject to the random on-site inspection are more likely to withdraw their applications. For the randomly inspected IPO applicants that continue with their applications, they are subject to a longer IPO review process, receive more inquiries from the Issuance Examination Committee, and are more likely to be vetoed by the Issuance Examination Committee. In addition, the randomly inspected IPO applicants that receive the final IPO approval are less likely to experience future disclosure restatements and enjoy a higher earnings response coefficient than non-randomly inspected IPO applicants. Overall, our results suggest the positive role that public enforcement plays in improving the quality of IPOs in a weak institutional environment.",

  "text": "Venue\nM714, 7/F, Block M, PolyU Map \nSpeaker\nProf. Ningzhong Li\nWe argue substitution exists among CSR investments and exogenously increasing one CSR investment could lead to a decrease in another CSR investment. We provide evidence using the U.S. states’ staggered adoptions of E-Verify mandates, which curtails a labor-related social bad by reducing the hiring of unauthorized workers and related workplace abuses. We find the mandate leads to an increase in plant-level pollution, an environmental social bad, and the effect is stronger when the mandate applies to more employers, for plants in states with more unauthorized workers in the labor force, and for plants with jobs that are inherently more hazardous.",

  "text": "Abstract:\nIn this paper, we document an alternative environmental regulation enforcement mechanism – enforcement by local leaders, who have stronger incentives and means to control pollution than environmental agencies – and examine its consequences. We show that pollution firms in cities with environmental pressure experience a decrease in profitability, output and sales revenue. While pollution firms release less SO2, we do not find any evidence suggesting that firms respond to environmental pressure through technological progress and process improvement. Further, pollution firms have lower probability to survive over longer term when facing environmental pressure. Overall, our findings suggest that, at the order of local governments, firms under environmental pressure behave in a short-term manner, such as reducing production activities or shutting down pollution facilities temporarily, to achieve environmental targets.",

  "text": "Recordkeepers in DC pension plans are often paid indirectly in the form of revenue sharing from third-party funds on the menu. We show that these arrangements affect the investment menu of 401(k) plans. Revenue-sharing funds are more likely to be added to the menu and are less likely to be deleted. Overall, revenue-sharing plans are more expensive as higher expense ratios are not offset by lower direct fees or by superior performance. Rebates increase with the market power of the recordkeeper suggesting that third-party funds may revenue share to gain access to retirement assets.",

  "text": "We examine the impact of loss aversion on voluntary disclosure behavior. Incorporating investors with prospect theory preferences into the classic voluntary disclosure setting of Dye (1985), we generate a novel, three-threshold equilibrium where managers voluntarily disclose ‘mildly bad’ but withhold ‘mildly good’ news. This asymmetric disclosure behavior is driven by managers strategically seeking to avoid the costs imposed by investor loss aversion associated with missing earnings expectations. This behavior is consistent with existing empirical evidence documenting that managers strategically guide down market expectations to avoid negative earnings surprises. The model predicts that the effect will be strongest in those settings where the degree of loss aversion among investors is most pronounced and when the signal is precise. We also find that outside these mild news regions, traditional disclosure predictions still hold. Namely, managers disclose ‘very good’ and withhold ‘very bad’ news because the influence of loss aversion diminishes quickly the farther the news is from the meet-or-beat threshold. ",

  "text": "This paper combines a novel hand-collected dataset with a machine learning (ML) classification approach to measure environmental and social targets in executive compensation (“ES Pay”). We find that one-third of public U.S. firms adopt ES Pay, which is under-estimated by commercially available data, increased substantially over time, is higher in polluting industries, and varies with firm characteristics such as size and CEO tenure. Although ES Pay does not affect compensation levels, it reduces pay-for-financial performance sensitivity and, at least temporarily, operating performance. Using four ES indices yields evidence that ES Pay increases index scores, especially if the targets are quantitative and linked to compensation via modifiers or formulas instead of discretion. However, there is no evidence for a reduction in emissions, possibly because executives focus on ES-related issues that are easier to improve.",
