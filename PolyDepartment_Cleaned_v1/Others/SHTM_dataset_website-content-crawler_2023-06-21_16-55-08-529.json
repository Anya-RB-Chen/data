Over 130 participants attended the event including Dr. Catherine Cheung, Associate Dean, Dr. Sebastian Filep, Assistant Dean, Prof. Honggen Xiao, Assistant Dean, Dr. Eric Chan, Undergraduate Programme Director and other SHTM faculty members. \nAfter welcoming the participants, Dean Chon presented the SHTM Outstanding Student Mentor of the Year Award 2022 to Mr. John Drummond, General Manager, InterContinental Grand Stanford HK, and the Outstanding Student Mentee of the Year Award 2022 to Ms. Yana Fomenko, who is currently our year two hotel management student. \nOver the remainder of the year, the 78 student mentors and 94 mentees will maintain regular contact to achieve the learning objectives they have agreed on. \nPlease put at least one valid content allocate to this component.\nThe SHTM Mentorship Programme helps participating students to learn more about the hospitality & tourism industry and gain career contacts. Once a student has been paired with a student mentor, it is the student's responsibility to initiate contact with the mentor. Throughout the year, the student will personally meet with his/her mentor five times. In-between meetings, he/she should communicate with the mentor frequently via email and telephone, fostering not only friendship but mutual trust. The School encourages students to ask their mentor anything and everything they can, to help them learn the industry's \"unwritten rules\".\nStudent mentors will serve as advisors, coaches, and counsellors to their assigned student mentees, influencing their progress and helping to create a competent, qualified up-and-coming workforce, which in turn benefits the hospitality and tourism industry as a whole. In return for sharing their expertise and experience, the programme provides an excellent opportunity for mentors to identify and recruit talented and promising graduates, as well as added status within the industry stemming from their guidance roles.\nEach mentor is required to meet with their mentee(s) five times per year, and to keep in touch at other times by telephone and email. Student mentees will ask many questions in their efforts to gain knowledge about the industry, ranging from simple enquires about resume writing to more complex requests about interpersonal relations in the workplace.\nStudent Mentees\nThe SHTM distributes programme application forms to all eligible students, usually in November, and matches each approved applicant with a student mentor.\n\nStudent Mentors\nAlumni applicants should have at least five years of experience in the hotel and tourism industry. The School also recruits non-alumni applicants such as senior-level or experienced personnel in hotels, travel agents and catering organisations.\nTo learn more about the SHTM Mentorship Programme, please contact:\nDr Eric Chan\nTel: +852 3400-2163\nFax: +852 2362-9362\nEmail: eric.sw.chan@polyu.edu.hk\n\nStudent Mentorship Programme application form",

He is a stellar role model for all SHTM students, and, indeed, all hospitality students around the world.”\nExpressing his heartfelt congratulations to Dr Ho on receiving the honour, Prof. Kaye CHON, SHTM Dean, Chair Professor and Walter and Wendy Kwok Family Foundation Professor in International Hospitality Management, said, “A pioneer and an inspirational role model, Dr Ho’s exemplary accomplishments have not only played an important role in raising the level of the regional and global hospitality business but also helped transform it through a distinctively Asian focus. A firm believer in education, he is an ardent supporter of hospitality and tourism education. Dr Ho is a longstanding partner of the SHTM and a truly deserving recipient of this award.”\nDr Ho remarked, “I am deeply honoured and humbled to be conferred the SHTM Lifetime Achievement Award. Ironically, it was long ago, during my tenure as Chairman of the SHTM International Advisory Board that I suggested the creation of the Lifetime Achievement Award, so that we could honour the pioneers of hospitality in Asia. The initial awardees were truly giants of our industry and inspired people of my generation. To join their ranks is truly an honour I could not have possibly envisaged.”\n“Under the long and visionary leadership of Dean Chon, the SHTM has become clearly the most prestigious tertiary hospitality school in Asia, and among the top few in the world. An entire generation of Asian hospitality leaders owe many of their achievements to the education which Dean Chon and his colleagues provided them,” he continued.\nDr Ho Kwon Ping is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Banyan Tree Holdings and Laguna Resorts and Hotels, and Executive Chairman of Thai Wah Public Company. All three family-owned companies are listed in Singapore and Thailand.\nDr Ho was the founding Chairman of Singapore Management University and has also chaired Singapore Power and MediaCorp Singapore. He has served on the boards of Standard Chartered Bank, Diageo, Singapore Airlines and GIC.\nAmong various awards, Dr Ho has received the London Business School Entrepreneurship Award; CEO of the Year at the Singapore Corporate Awards; CNBC Travel Business Leader Award; Distinguished Alumnus Award from the National University of Singapore; and Lifetime Achievement Awards from the American Creativity Association, China Hotel Investment Summit and Australia Hotel Investment Summit. Honoured for his contributions and accomplishments in the hotel industry in the Asia Pacific region and globally, Dr Ho is the only two-time recipient of the awards bestowed by the Hotel Investment Conference Asia Pacific – Innovation Award (2003) and Lifetime Achievement Award (2019) – in its 30-year establishment.\nFor his services to the country, he has been decorated with the Meritorious Service Medal and Distinguished Service Order by the Singapore government. Dr Ho has also been conferred honorary doctorates by Johnson & Wales University and PolyU.\n“The SHTM prides itself as a leading force in world hospitality, and tourism research and education,” said Dean Chon. “Our commitment to excellence is well supported by industry heavyweights and visionaries such as Dr Ho Kwon Ping. With steadfast support from our industry partners, our School is committed to nurturing the bright minds who will become future leaders of this very exciting global industry.”\nThe Gallery of Honour is located in the SHTM lobby. It displays portraits of the outstanding recipients of the Award, individuals who represent the world's most successful hospitality organisations and recognisable brands.

  "text": "Recent developments in neuroscience are gradually revealing the secrets of human brain and empowering researchers to uncover the underlying mechanisms behind human behaviour. The marriage between neuroscience and hospitality and tourism is believed to offer an alternative means to understand tourists' behaviour.\nThe Hospitality and Tourism Research Centre (HTRC) of the SHTM organised and hosted a workshop entitled \"Application of Neuroscience Approach in Hospitality and Tourism Research\" on 18 November 2020, during which the SHTM research team shared basic technologies in neuroscience and discussed the prospects for their application in hospitality and tourism research.\nThe workshop was led by Dr Mimi Li, SHTM Associate Professor, who, together with her research assistant Mr Guyang Lin, introduced the working principles, technical advantages, specific applications and experimental protocol of electroencephalography (EEG), a type of neuroimaging technique. Dr Mimi Li and SHTM Assistant Professor Dr Youngjoon Choi then shared their respective research using this new technique, providing attendees with a more intuitive understanding of the neuroscientific approach in hospitality and tourism research. The workshop also featured a live demonstration by the EEG equipment supplier with enthusiastic participation from attendees.\nThe afternoon session of the workshop featured an introduction and demonstration of eye-tracking (EM) technique. EM is a sensor technology for measuring eye positions and movements, and is widely used in a variety of disciplines including cognitive science, human-computer interaction and marketing research. Although EM is not a neuroscientific method, it is commonly regarded as an auxiliary technique used in concert with neuroimaging. Through the presentation by the EM equipment supplier, attendees gained a basic idea of the working principles and specific applications of EM and the operation of EM instruments. They also had the opportunity to take a closer look at the device and to experience the feeling of wearing an EM device first-hand.\nThe \"Application of Neuroscience Approach in Hospitality and Tourism Research\" workshop not only provided an introduction to a new field and methodology, but also emphasised an interactive practice to stimulate attendees' interest and enthusiasm. The SHTM was delighted to host the workshop and looks forward to a deeper and broader interdisciplinary collaboration to innovate a brand-new vision.",

  "text": "Many organisations take pride in their ability to offer a rich variety of supportive programmes for employees with families. However, the growing number of single childless people in the workforce, especially members of Generations Y and Z, rarely benefit from equivalent perks or policies. Does the hospitality industry care about single childless employees? Curious as to whether organisational support can benefit hotels and their employees, Dr Xiaolin (Crystal) Shi of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and her co-author quizzed hotel employees in China about their experiences. The fruits of their comprehensive analysis will help organisations to create more supportive environments for employees, whilst also boosting hotel outcomes.\nNow more than ever, single employees without children dominate the labour-intensive hotel industry. Perhaps thanks to the false assumption that they have more free time and fewer responsibilities, “members of this group are often expected to shoulder heavier workloads, work longer hours, and travel more for work to support the family demands of their married colleagues”, say the researchers. They have also been found to engage in more emotional labour, to have less decision-making latitude, and to face more negative work–nonwork spillover than employees who are in a couple and/or have children. This highlights the emerging need to ascertain the workplace challenges faced by single childless employees in the hotel industry.\nCommon to all employees is the challenge of achieving a “work–life balance”, which is the harmony between a individual’s different roles, responsibilities and personal values. Whilst the concept of a work–family balance has been examined in great depth, it is not necessarily relevant to single childless people, whose “personal” roles are less likely to be family-related. “The commonly used terms ‘work–family conflict’ and ‘family-supportive organisational culture’ do not apply to all”, explain the researchers.\nThey therefore inspected the experiences of “personal-to-work conflict”, which occurs when personal activities infringe on professional ones, and “work-to-personal conflict”, which occurs when job demands require a sacrifice of personal time and energy. A potential way to minimise these kinds of conflicts and strike a healthy work–life balance is through the provision of “organisational support”.\nFamily-supportive work cultures can increase job satisfaction and performance—similar benefits might reasonably be expected by providing organisational support to single people without children. A singles-friendly organisational culture is one that nurtures a work-life balance equally among employees, and not just in those who are married or with children. For this, it is crucial to acknowledge that family life and personal life are not one and the same. “Previous work has suggested that the work domain, family domain, and personal domain should be treated separately”, explain the authors.\nSocial inclusion is a key dimension of a singles-friendly work culture, and especially relevant to single childless employees, who are known to suffer more from social isolation and loneliness. “A high level of organisational support is typically linked with positive organisational outcomes”, say the authors, “and social inclusion has been associated with both affective organisational commitment and perceived organisational support.” The researchers therefore predicted that a strong socially inclusive organisational culture would reduce personal-to-work and work-to-personal conflicts.\nDissatisfaction and apathy can ensue when there is a discrepancy between desired and actual work-life balance. In addition, employees who feel that the available support is simply not enough to overcome work-life conflicts have heightened stress levels. “For single childless employees, the incongruence between their perceptions of work–personal conflicts and relevant support from their organisations may result in negative consequences, such as lower job performance”, say the researchers. Accordingly, they predicted that an organisational-level social inclusion of a singles-friendly culture would yield better job performance.\nSocial inclusion of a singles-friendly culture might also have the power to boost the enjoyment got from leisure activities. Leisure activities contribute to psychological well-being and life satisfaction, and the loss of the freedom to engage in them can sour attitudes towards one’s own personal life. “Hospitality employees in particular may have less time and energy for leisure activities after work, preventing them from satisfying their need for relaxation or resulting in lower levels of leisure satisfaction”, say the researchers. An organisational culture geared towards improving employees’ work-life balance could therefore boost leisure satisfaction.\nThe researchers gathered rich data from total of 639 full-time employees, who were recruited from 29 full-service hotels in China. Participants completed a pre-developed questionnaires that measured personal-to-work and work-to-personal conflicts, leisure satisfaction, and their perception of the degree of social inclusion of a singles-friendly culture. Job performance was assessed using a survey completed by participants’ direct supervisors, who rated items such as “this employee performs tasks that are expected of him/her.” Hierarchical linear modelling was then applied to examine the relationships between variables, whilst controlling for potential confounding variables, such as whether participants were men or women.\nThe results were unambiguous. Single childless employees who worked in hotels with a socially inclusive culture had notably less conflict between their work and personal domains, a more impressive job performance, and more satisfaction from leisure activities. “These findings highlight the significance of the social inclusion of a singles-friendly culture for both employees and organisations”, say the researchers. As a second intriguing finding, the effect of an inclusive organisational culture on employees’ job performance and leisure satisfaction were shaped by their degree of work-to-personal conflict. This, clarify the authors, could be explained by the important role of personal domain variables in influencing employees’ perceptions.\nSuch clear-cut findings should easily persuade managers to embrace a singles-friendly culture to enable a balance between the work and personal roles of single childless employees. Hotels could establish programs and policies to eliminate negative stereotyping, and should not solely focus on the needs of married and parent employees. “Although single childless employees do not require support for family responsibilities, they do require support for personal and social matters”, reiterate the authors. Hotels could also facilitate an enhanced mutual understanding between single and married employees through team-building activities, which would inspire more harmonious and productive relationships in the workplace.\nThe nature of social inclusion of a singles-friendly culture varied from hotel to hotel. “As such”, explain the researchers, “hotels should take their unique organisational cultures and characteristics into consideration when developing socially inclusive programs.” Hotel chains could, for instance infuse their mission and core values into inclusive policies and programs, and make sure that the same support is provided across all of their hotels. This would mean that employees who are transferred from one hotel to another of the same chain can more rapidly assimilate into their new working environment and immediately feel a sense of belonging.\nWith fewer people than ever in their 30s and 40s choosing to get married or have children, the hospitality workforce is increasingly home to single childless workers. This pioneering new work shows that the time has come to address their needs. “The study can assist hotel industry managers in recognising single childless employees as an important, distinct, and growing segment of the labour force”, conclude the authors. As well as several managerial implications, this investigation also paves the way for more exciting research. For example, future work could additionally consider how a supportive culture affects other workers who also have a “non-traditional” family structure, such as those in a same-sex relationship.\nShi, Xiaolin (Crystal), and Shi, Jieyu (Jade) (2022).

Timely new research by Dr Hyejo Hailey Shin of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and a co-author offers an in-depth look at which elements of virtual trips are the most essential, and how these can be used to encourage returning tourists’ behavioural intentions via immersion and nostalgia. Intriguingly, stirring the emotions and nostalgia of returning tourists can boost their intention to revisit a destination, visit a similar destination and speak positively about travel experiences with others. These illuminating findings could prove vital for destination management organisations as the industry regains its footing in the wake of COVID-19.\nVirtual reality is widely considered one of the most exciting advances in the technological world, with a vast array of anticipated applications in various domains. This immersive technology allows users to vividly interact with computer-generated features in a simulated virtual environment, and so has attracted keen interest in the tourism sector. “Many tourism organisations have launched virtual trips, a combination of virtual reality and tourism contents, to promote themselves as a travel destination choice during the post-pandemic era”, say the researchers.\nVirtual “previews” of destinations are often used to showcase previously unimagined travel possibilities and surprising locations to new tourists, while simultaneously assuaging their travel doubts. Nonetheless, despite these advantages for attracting first-time visitors, many tourism destinations’ primary targets are returning visitors who have already been to the destination in question. As the researchers note, “It would be ideal if tourism destinations could promote travellers’ positive feelings about their past memories in the destination in order to increase their revisit intentions”. This is where virtual reality could get a chance to shine.\nFor virtual trips to appeal to returning travellers, they need to evoke fond recollections of past travel adventures. For this, returning travellers need to feel fully immersed and involved. Building on previous work, the researchers hypothesised that better-quality interactivity, usability and sensorial appeal would increase immersion. They also predicted that more realistic representations of a destination would heighten immersion. This “authenticity” is all the more critical for returning travellers, who are bound to notice if a virtual trip does not match up with their actual experiences. Most crucially, true immersion in a virtual trip elicits an emotional response. “When travellers are deeply immersed, their emotional responses become stronger”, report the researchers.\nNostalgia is a person’s intense positive feelings about their own memories. Considering that travel is all about providing tangible experiences through which new memories are born, nostalgia naturally holds a special place in tourism research. Three types of tourist nostalgia are recognised in the literature: destination nostalgia; nostalgia for past lives and the desire to relive days gone by; and nostalgia for social activities, or the emotion surrounding travel memories of moments shared with others. The researchers predicted that all three types of nostalgia would be positively influenced by travellers’ immersion in a virtual trip. Moreover, “although these three types of nostalgia are directed towards different objects, they might occur simultaneously”, they say.\nWhen considering the potential effects of nostalgia, a key concept is the well-known “stimulus–organism–response paradigm”. This posits that emotions compel a person to behave in a certain way, such that strong feelings sway responses to the environment. If so, a virtual trip should also have behavioural knock-on effects for travellers. “As an affective response, nostalgia has been considered an important antecedent of travellers’ behavioural intentions”, report the authors. For this reason, they tested whether nostalgia increased a tourist’s intention to revisit a destination, intention to visit a similar destination, and intention to share their memories of the destination with others. These are three critical indicators of travellers’ favourable attitudes towards a destination.\nTo address a final point of curiosity, the authors looked at whether tourists’ personalities played a role in the relationships between nostalgia and behavioural intentions. More self-confident and daring “allocentric” tourists might rather discover unchartered destinations than revisit a previous one, despite a strong sense of nostalgia. Less adventurous “psychocentric” tourists, who tend to prefer comfort and convenience, might be more inclined to revisit a familiar place, even if they do not feel particularly nostalgic on looking back. “Therefore, we investigated the moderating effect of travel personality in the relationship between nostalgia and future behavioural intention”, report the researchers.\nWhat better study site than the theme park capital of the world? Sifting through travel records made available by the Orlando Destination Management Organisation, the researchers identified and contacted 303 individuals who had visited Orlando, Florida since 2015. These participants were invited to take a virtual trip via an Internet link and then complete a comprehensive survey compiled from previous publications. In this survey, the participants were asked to assess the interactivity, usability, sensorial appeal and authenticity of the virtual trip; their immersion in the trip; their felt nostalgia for the destination, past life and social activities; and their behavioural intentions. The authors also measured the participants’ travel “personality”, using an existing scale.\nImmersion in the virtual trip was found to hinge on authenticity and sensorial appeal, which demonstrates the importance of including high-quality, representative content in virtual trips to intensify engagement and involvement. To get the most from revisiting tourists, tourism destinations should therefore devote energy to accurately portraying a destination’s atmosphere and including rich sensorial appeals. “By increasing travellers’ immersion in virtual trips”, explain the researchers, “[destination marketing organisations] will be able to arouse nostalgia for the destination, generating travellers’ intention to revisit the destination”. Indeed, immersion in the virtual experience significantly increased all three forms of nostalgia.\nDestination nostalgia increased the intention to revisit the destination and to visit a similar destination, which indicates that virtual trips could be used to attract both returning and new tourists. For this reason, the researchers recommend that marketing strategies incorporate “coopetition” to create a win–win situation for destinations. “It would be beneficial to form a strategic alliance with destinations which share similar destination characteristics so that they can offer virtual trips to the destination and partner destinations to attract potential visitors”, they suggest. Destination nostalgia also increased the intention to spread positive word-of-mouth, which is a sure-fire way to attract potential visitors in the tourism industry.\nTravellers’ behavioural intentions were not affected by the two other types of nostalgia, however. According to the authors, the nonsignificant effect of nostalgia for past lives/social activities is not necessarily unsurprising – tourists may not actually need to return to the same destination to re-experience their past lives or social activities. Finally, whilst destination nostalgia had a much stronger effect on revisit intention in psychocentric travellers, “even allocentric travellers were willing to revisit the destination after their virtual trip because of their nostalgia for the destination”, report the researchers. This is welcome news for destination marketing organisations.\nThese insights could inspire new ideas for channelling the skyrocketing significance of technology in the tourism sector. Virtual trips can invoke sweet, pleasant memories and thereby arouse nostalgia, which results in behavioural intentions that are ultimately beneficial for the tourism industry. However, the participants’ travel intentions were almost certainly affected by the COVID-19 travel restrictions imposed at the time of data collection. “As the travel restriction has continued, travellers’ intention to travel might be strengthened due to their reduced self-control”, acknowledge the researchers. “The findings could be different if there were no travel restrictions”. Certainly, never before have innovative tools to reboot the tourism industry been so urgently called for, further highlighting the important guidance provided by this research for destination marketing organisations.\nShin, Hyejo Hailey and Jeong, Miyoung (2022).

  "text": "In today’s travel and events industries, multiple service providers work together to shape unique, complex and multidimensional customer experiences. However, such connectedness can come at a cost. Within a network or ecosystem of service providers, a single service failure can have cascading effects on all stakeholders. Yet we still know little about the optimal strategies for service recovery in such networked contexts. Filling this gap in the literature, Dr Karin Weber and Professor Cathy Hsu of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University shed light on how customers perceive and react to service failure and recovery measures in today’s complexly interlinked business environments. Their findings offer crucial guidance for travel and events practitioners on ensuring that customers are as satisfied as possible following service failure.\nWhilst the customer–firm dyad was central to service scenarios in the early 2000s, the situation today is very different, with increasingly interconnected service providers, environments and dynamics. Service quality now depends on complex networks and ecosystems of interacting partners that share resources, tools and goals and whose failures can have far-reaching effects. Surprisingly, however, research has thus far failed to consider service failure (SF) and recovery measures in networked contexts. As a result, strategies for optimising service encounters in the modern world remain suboptimal. “The time has come to expand service research”, say the researchers, “to understand the development of service systems, networks, and ecosystems”.\nTravel experiences are a good example of networked service provision, as they involve a range of stakeholders – such as airlines, hotels and destinations – that collaboratively create value for travellers. Similarly, customer experiences in the rapidly growing events industry are shaped by multiple “loosely connected” entities, such as event organisers, venues, sponsors and destinations. SF is fairly common in the events industry. “Music festivals in particular are prone to failure,” say the authors, “with wide-ranging implications for the various stakeholders”. To date, however, no consensus has been reached on how to respond to SF in the networked environments of today’s travel and events industries.\nImagine the following scenario. A theatre company partners with a nearby restaurant and taxi firm in return for meal discounts and reliable transportation after performances. However, their collaboration is disrupted by an SF caused by the taxi firm. When a service experience is coordinated in this way, how do network members determine which party or parties should undertake SF recovery and how to protect their respective reputations?\nCustomers care about the source of SF recovery. They may even expect non-responsible entities to implement recovery, the authors tell us, “despite their potentially limited ability to do so”. Research has shown that firms can benefit from implementing external recovery efforts, but only when they are unaffiliated with the party responsible for the SF. “An SF by one firm actually creates an opportunity to enhance customer evaluations of a different firm in a contiguous service experience”, the authors deduce. To explore this issue in more depth, they compared customers’ responses to SF recovery implemented by different parties: the firm responsible for the SF, a firm affiliated with the responsible firm, a firm unaffiliated with the responsible firm, and multiple affiliated firms.\nCustomers’ responses to SF recovery may also hinge on their assessment of how fairly the SF has been dealt with. In general, customers who have experienced failure are looking for justice. This, say the researchers, “relates to customers’ perceptions of the fairness of actual outcomes or consequences”, such as the provision of monetary or non-monetary compensation. The researchers compared the effectiveness of compensation versus a sincere apology in limiting customer dissatisfaction following SF. They also filled a gap in research by exploring whether and how customer responses to recovery efforts were affected by the severity of the SF.\nTo empirically examine customer responses to SF and recovery measures, the researchers carefully designed and administered two online script-based surveys. In Study 1, 207 participants were asked to imagine that they had arranged to attend an international music festival but subsequently encountered an SF in the form of an airline overbooking, a delayed flight or a missed flight connection. They were then presented with one of four external recovery scenarios, in which the recovery was implemented by either an airline alliance partner (affiliated recovery firm) or a hotel (unaffiliated recovery firm) and the recovery outcome was either compensation, in the form of an upgrade, or an apology. The participants rated their satisfaction with, intention to recommend via word of mouth and repeat purchase intention regarding the recovery firm.\nStudy 2 extended this consecutive two-firm context to an event experience created by several service providers. Seasoned festival-goers were asked to imagine that they had purchased tickets for a music festival, along with transportation to and accommodation at the festival site, before encountering an SF. Splitting the participants into six groups, the authors measured the effect of SF severity (minor problems encountered at the festival versus a cancelled flight) on the participants’ evaluation of the event organiser, venue, sponsor and destination.\nIn Study 2, the researchers also compared the participants’ responses to recovery implemented by the responsible party, namely the event organiser (which provided compensation in the form of a partial ticket refund/donation to a national charity), versus recovery implemented jointly by all four entities (which provided either compensation, i.e., a free concert ticket, or an apology). Again, the participants’ satisfaction, word of mouth recommendation intention and repeat purchase intention were recorded.\nAs expected, Study 1 revealed higher customer ratings for satisfaction, word of mouth intention and repeat purchase intention for the recovery firm that was unaffiliated (versus affiliated) with the firm responsible for the SF. In general, customers preferred to be compensated than to receive an apology, but affiliated firms had the most to gain from offering compensation. “A tangible goodwill gesture is more effective than a simple apology if a firm wants to take advantage of an SF by another service provider”, add the researchers. For example, hotels could extend checkout times for guests with delayed flights to minimise negative customer responses.\nStudy 2 confirmed that SF severity also impacted consumer evaluations. In the high-severity scenario, the event organiser (responsible for the SF) received particularly low ratings relative to the other three entities involved in the experience creation. Surprisingly, however, consumer evaluations and behaviours were not more positive following external recovery by affiliated entities than following internal recovery by the entity to blame for the SF, the event organiser. According to the researchers, this suggests that costly efforts made by affiliated firms to appease frustrated customers may not result in “more favourable consumer evaluations of and behaviour toward the entities implementing such external recovery measures”.\nThe results also showed that the kind of compensation offered should be carefully considered. Study 2 revealed that offering a free ticket to a concert in the future actually increased the frustration of non-local festival-goers, who had already made travel and accommodation arrangements. In contrast, Study 1 showcased the advantages of immediate and/or flexible compensation offered by airlines and hotels. “In a festival context,” conclude the authors, “any external recovery offered by affiliated stakeholders should not only be of similar value but also be immediate and flexible in nature”.\nMoving beyond the dyadic business–consumer interactions of the past, this study breaks new ground by examining SF and recovery measures in a networked world. Its results provide much-needed guidance for modern travel and events practitioners seeking to limit customer dissatisfaction following SFs caused by various stakeholders. To optimise their recovery strategies, network members should carefully consider SF severity, choose the right party or parties to implement recovery and determine the most appropriate type of compensation. As the researchers note, these insights may be particularly relevant in “extraordinarily challenging business environments” such as those created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWeber, Karin, and Hsu, Cathy H.

  "text": "2020 saw unprecedented swathes of holiday cancellations. The year COVID-19 hit was a tough one for hospitality and tourism firms, who were forced to make swift decisions about changes to their refund policies. However, no one could clearly envisage how those crisis-induced changes would impact customer loyalty and trust. In the first study of its kind, Dr Daniel Leung and Ms Christine Seah of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University looked at customer reactions to generous or self-serving refund policy changes, and whether these are shaped further by the magnitude of changes and the format in which refunds are offered. This inspiring work will help industry practitioners to optimise refund policy strategies in the future.\nWithout question, the COVID-19 pandemic was a brutal shock to the hotel industry. Confronted with unimaginable numbers of cancellation requests and refund claims, for the main part the industry reacted sympathetically to customers. Some hotels, such as Hilton and Premier Inn, started allowing refunds on previously non-refundable purchases during the crisis, and Expedia and Travelodge offered customers cash or vouchers to be used on future bookings. “Helping consumers in need during crises is considered to be an altruistic behaviour, even though the changes may result in financial losses”, say the researchers.\nHowever, a few companies took a more selfish path. EasyJet and British Airways, for instance, breached cancellation promises and denied their customers any refunds during the pandemic period. Negatively changing refund policies from fully refundable to partially or non-refundable might go some way to limit a firm’s financial losses in the short term, but it is a rude violation of the initial promises made to customers. According to the researchers, these actions are “likely to reduce consumers’ trust of the company and even their intention to repurchase products from that same company in the future”.\nHow did these two strategically distinct crisis-induced reactions affect customer behaviours and attitudes? Until now, the effect of the “polarity” of change, that is, whether refund policy changes are positive or negative for consumers, has been left unmapped. The researchers reasoned that “if one hotel behaves egoistically and changes a policy to benefit themselves only, consumers would perceive that policy change as an unfair business practice”. They predicted that this “opportunistic” behaviour would decrease consumers’ trust and lower their intention to repurchase products from that company. Conversely, positive changes should increase trust and repurchase intentions.\nImagine your feelings on learning that you are to receive a refund, only to then find out that the refund is small, or that it comes in the format of a voucher that can only be used within the next two months. Would that token gesture be satisfactory? Previous work has considered refund policy as a “one-off” or “static” event, without fully considering the detailed characteristics of changes. “Another objective of this study was to examine the effects of the interplay of the polarity of change in refund policy, the magnitude of change in refund policy, and refund format on consumers’ trust of the company and repurchase intention”, explain the researchers.\nLarger price reductions can boost consumers’ purchase intention. After all, who wouldn’t prefer a 30% over a 15% discount? Indeed, larger magnitude changes can be exponentially beneficial for companies. “One study shows that consumer spending in a store with a larger magnitude of change increases by 12%, while the corresponding figure in a store with a smaller magnitude of change increases by just 1%”, report the researchers. This magnitude-of-change effect might also translate to a refund policy context. Meanwhile, refund format can also affect customer responses, whereby cash refunds are generally preferred over credit refunds. “This research complements existing literature by demonstrating how consumers react differently when a company changes its refund policy in various forms”, say the researchers.\nClues from past work indicate that a large magnitude of change causes a strong “contrast effect” that drives the intensity of customer responses, be it in a positive or negative direction, whilst a small magnitude of change results in an “assimilation effect” that dampens customer responses. For companies that implement a negative change in refund policy, the researchers hypothesised that a large magnitude of change would decrease consumer trust and intention to repurchase products more than a small change. “If a company changes its refund policy positively”, specify the authors, “and the magnitude of change is high (low), consumers’ trust in that company and intention to repurchase products from the same company will be significantly higher (lower)”.\nIn two elegant studies, participants were asked to imagine that they had made holiday plans to visit New York but were obliged to cancel their hotel reservation due to a health crisis. In study 1, the researchers looked at the effect of the polarity and magnitude of changes in refund policy. For this, 144 participants read a set of emails that were carefully constructed to reflect either a positive or negative policy change, and either a large (100%) or small (50%) magnitude of change. For example, a negative change of large magnitude was reflected by an initial booking email explaining that a refund would be possible, followed by a cancellation email stating that no refund was offered due to the crisis. In study 2, 319 participants were shown emails that reflected either a positive or negative change, as well as whether the 50% refund that was offered would be in the form of cash or credit. In both studies, trust in the company and repurchase intention were assessed using a questionnaire.\nAs expected, positive changes to refund policies resulted in higher levels of consumer trust and repurchase intentions, whilst negative changes decreased trust and loyalty. “The execution of self-beneficial actions during crises reduces consumers’ trust of a company and their intention to repurchase products from that same company in the future”, report the researchers. This means that hospitality practitioners should expect consumers’ brand evaluation and future behaviour to deteriorate when they change their refund policies negatively in response to a health crisis.\nFor companies that made a negative policy change that was large in magnitude, the detrimental impacts of negative change in refund policy on consumers’ trust and loyalty were magnified. This means that companies who enact negative changes should be careful to do so gently, at modest levels. “In contrast, when a refund policy is changed positively and mildly, the degree of gain becomes less evident”, say the researchers. In other words, if companies are prepared to bear financial losses to favour consumers during crises, they should make sure that those positive changes are large in magnitude.\nFinally, refund format impacted the influence of polarity of change in refund policy. For both negative and positive policy changes, cash refunds amplified the impact of the polarity of change in refund policy. Namely, when companies that negatively changed their policy offered cash refunds, trust and repurchase intention were lower than when credit was offered. When companies that positively changed their policy offered cash refunds, trust and repurchase intentions were higher than when credit was offered. Hence, to mitigate losses, companies that negatively change their refund policy should offer credit refunds, whereas companies that make positive changes should offer cash rather than credit refunds. “This will further enhance consumers’ trust, as well as customers’ intention to repurchase products from the same company in the future”, explain the researchers.\nWhilst refund policies are widely embraced by hospitality and tourism business, research in this area has been lacking. This long-awaited investigation casts light on what practitioners can expect to see when they make strategic changes to refund policies. As well as keeping their heads above water, companies must strive to retain customer trust and loyalty in times of crisis. This fascinating work shows how consumers process and react to policy change, and could therefore prove to be immeasurably useful in strategic decision making about refund policy. “This research generates insights into how to adequately change refund policies in order to mitigate additional losses in the future”, conclude the authors.\nLeung, Daniel and Seah, Christine (2022).

  "text": "下載\nThe School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (28 April) announced the findings of a study on “A Decision Support System for Post-COVID Tourism Policy Formation and Monitoring”. The study developed a cloud-based social listening platform, TOUROMETER, to measure Hong Kong residents’ sentiment towards visitors and tourism development as well as visitors’ sentiment towards Hong Kong tourism. \nInstead of using traditional measures such as classification of attitudes as either positive or negative to estimate support for tourism, this project introduces a more refined concept, ambivalence, that can capture individuals’ simultaneously held positive and negative views. The platform offers a tool for policymakers to monitor the ambivalence of relevant stakeholders towards tourists and tourism development, as well as an effective channel for public engagement to help achieve collaborative planning.\nSpearheaded by Prof. Cathy HSU, Principal Investigator and SHTM Chair Professor, the project was funded by the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme, Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office. The project employed rigorous research methodologies, including the analysis of longitudinal news and social media big data through meta machine learning, and statistical modeling using economy, environment, tourism and census data.\nOver the past four years, social unrest and COVID-19 have imposed unprecedented setbacks on Hong Kong tourism. The challenges, however, signify opportunities for reviewing past experience in order to shed light on more effective policymaking in the future. In particular, policies to attract Mainland Chinese tourists, the dominant source market representing 78% of arrivals to Hong Kong in 2018, and to spearhead a healthy post-COVID tourism recovery deserve holistic consideration. “Since the launch of the Individual Visit Scheme in 2003, the huge influx of Mainland Chinese tourists has facilitated exponential tourism growth but simultaneously imposed a heavy burden on local lives, which has intensified tensions between Hong Kong residents and tourists from the Mainland,” Prof. Hsu said. “A lesson to be learned is that understanding and monitoring residents’ and visitors’ sentiments is critical for effective policy formation and timely amendments to avoid detrimental and irreversible conflicts.”\nDeveloped by the project team, the TOUROMETER serves as a public policy decision support system to understand public voices in a timely and ongoing manner. The project has collected sentiment data from Hong Kong residents and Mainland Chinese tourists on popular social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Ctrip) and 19 major newspapers in Hong Kong from 2003 onward. The results show that:\n(1) Hong Kong residents’ dispositions based on news stories and those on social media posts are significantly different. Positive news stories do not necessarily mean positive social media postings. In general, resident disposition on social media is less positive and more ambivalent to Mainland Chinese tourists and tourism development than that found in the news.\n(2) Hong Kong residents’ disposition to Hong Kong tourism development is significantly correlated with their disposition towards Mainland Chinese tourists. The more ambivalent residents are to Mainland Chinese tourists, the more ambivalent they are to tourism development.\n(3) The economy, environment and quality of life have significant influences on Hong Kong residents’ dispositions towards Mainland Chinese tourists and tourism development. Specifically, the higher the GDP per capita and the worse air pollution experienced, the less positive and more ambivalent residents are to Mainland Chinese tourists; on the other hand, the higher the unemployment rate, the more positive and less ambivalent are views of Mainland Chinese tourists and tourism development.\n(4) Mainland Chinese tourists’ perception of Hong Kong tourism is significantly correlated with the Hong Kong economy, environment and resident sentiment. The better the economy and environment, the more positive the tourist perception of Hong Kong; however, the more negative the resident sentiment, the less positive the Mainland Chinese tourists’ perception is of Hong Kong tourism.\nIt is, therefore, important to balance the interests of residents and tourists to achieve social sustainability. As a useful tool for various tourism stakeholders, the TOUROMETER allows individuals’ opinions to be heard in a timely manner so that they can be used to inform public policymaking; industry practitioners to recognise social issues, and manage risks and opportunities effectively; and government to monitor public opinions holistically, and formulate or amend policies timely. When the sentiment trends below an acceptable level, policies can be devised or revised to address the issue. The factors identified as influencing residents’ and tourists’ perceptions of Hong Kong tourism should also be monitored. Appropriate policy measures can then be taken to cultivate positive and reduce negative sentiments.\nWith the re-opening of the border between Hong Kong and Mainland China, the Hong Kong tourism industry is ushering in spring after a long winter. It is an opportune time to balance various stakeholders’ interests for long-term competitiveness, as only where there are happy hosts, are there happy guests. “This study provides important information to better enable the Hong Kong government to effectively support the sustainable development of Hong Kong’s tourism industry” Prof. Hsu remarked. “The SHTM is proud to be able to support the development of the tourism industry in this significant way.”\nProf Cathy Hsu, Principal Investigator and SHTM Chair Professor presenting findings of a study on “A Decision Support System for Post-COVID Tourism Policy Formation and Monitoring”.\nMembers of the research team: (from left) Dr Nan Chen, Dr Christine Zeng, Prof Cathy Hsu, Mr Gary Tan and Mr Ziyang Zhan with Dean Kaye Chon (third from right) at the public seminar.\n***** \nAbout PolyU School of Hotel and Tourism Management\nFor over 40 years, the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University has refined a distinctive vision of hospitality and tourism education and become a world-leading hotel and tourism school.

  "text": "21 December 2022 \nWelcome to the Touch-Free Hotel \nContactless technology is transforming hospitality in China and beyond. Research by Dr Fei Hao and Professor Kaye Chon of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University shows that travellers have varying levels of readiness for contactless hotels. Hospitality firms are advised to be mindful of this variation when designing strategies to boost customer equity. For guests who are still sceptical about contactless technology, services that evoke delight may be the best way to retain their custom. Those with concerns around COVID-19 may be particularly reassured by positive experiences in a contactless hotel. \nThe pandemic has spurred a contactless trend that was already underway, with services like smartphone payment and Hong Kong’s Octopus travel card firmly established. The hotel sector is introducing a suite of high-tech contactless systems to protect guests and workers against infection. As the researchers note, “hospitality firms around the world have widely adopted voice control (e.g., smart speaker TVs), motion sensing (e.g., touchless elevators), and mobile control (e.g., mobile check-in and check-out).” In mainland China, many hotels offer technologies once considered futuristic, such as robotic room services and facial recognition at check-in. \nAlthough they are still far from universal, these features add to the hotel experience in several ways. Touch-free systems not only provided peace of mind during the pandemic but also improve the convenience and perhaps even sensory experience of a stay. Guests who feel safer and more comfortable feel more satisfied and are more likely to share their positive experiences via word- of-mouth. For hotels, these benefits directly increase “customer equity”, which the researchers define as “the sum of the discounted stream of cash flows generated from a company’s pool of customers.” \nHowever, from a business view, going contactless is not without risks. A hotel is a place that guests call home for days or even weeks. Are such visitors happy with a new mode of customer service that minimises touch? “Traditionally,” say the researchers, “the hospitality industry is based on the warmth of ‘human contact’, and misgivings have thus been raised about the efficacy of contactless service”. Customer equity may thus be damaged rather than increased by the contactless transformation, as guests who miss the traditional, tactile, personalised ways of hotel service may be on balance less satisfied with their stay, even if they appreciate the efforts to fight infection. \nContactless technology is expensive, especially when implemented at every step of a guest’s stay. A pandemic is no time for hotels to take reckless risks; the decision to make such a costly investment can only be justified if it gives a healthy return. However, the return on investment (ROI) of contactless hospitality has been neglected in the tourism marketing literature. Also understudied is the relationship between contactless service and customer experience, which has a major influence on the key metric of customer equity. To fill these gaps, the researchers decided to “explore the ROI of contactless hospitality from the perspective of customer equity” – that is, to pay attention to the factors promoting and threatening customer equity in contactless hotels. \nHotel guests are a diverse slice of humanity; they cannot all be expected to all react in the same way to the contactless trend. The researchers identified technology readiness as a key personal characteristic that influences consumer experience of contactless service. A person’s technology readiness is a persistent psychological disposition to feel a particular emotion – such as excitement, curiosity or unease – when interacting with new technology. Given its importance, the authors note that “the hospitality industry should integrate customers’ technology readiness into service design and marketing programs”. \nIn 2000, the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) was developed to gauge people’s optimism, innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity around new technology and thus measure their willingness to embrace technological change. The authors remind us that contactless technology “requires customers to engage more with the technology-based service ecosystem”. As people with higher technology readiness should be more comfortable in such an ecosystem, the researchers looked at whether TRI scores affected the relationship between customer experience and equity in contactless hotels. \nCustomer equity has three key components: “value”, “brand” and “relationship”. The researchers surveyed around 1,500 mainland Chinese residents who had stayed in contactless hotels to test how their personal characteristics and experiences influenced their customer equity. Innovatively, the researchers singled out customer delight – a guest’s unexpectedly high levels of joy and excitement – as an emotional reaction that may be just as decisive as a satisfaction rating when it comes to securing customer equity. \nIn addition to the survey on their contactless hotel experience, the participants took the TRI test to find out their level of technology readiness. Dividing the respondents into high and low TRI groups, the researchers hypothesised that technology readiness influences the relationship between customer experience, delight and equity. They also tested whether customer equity determined another crucial marketing outcome – brand trust. Did higher-equity customers place more trust in hotel brands, and was this affected by their level of concern around health issues in the pandemic? \nThe survey results showed that, as predicted, both customer experience and customer delight were strongly associated with customer equity. This serves as a reminder for hotel managers in the pandemic era not to forget the basics – satisfying and pleasing guests – when installing contactless systems to protect customers and staff. Indeed, the researchers recommend that “managers should form an organizational culture that engenders customer equity by creating a more satisfactory and delightful experience”. The findings confirmed the importance of customer equity not just for the financial bottom line but also for lasting customer relationships, as it was shown to greatly influence brand trust. \nWith particular relevance in the emerging post-pandemic era, the results also confirmed the role of health concerns. The trust-building effect of customer equity was strongest for contactless hotel guests who paid the most attention to COVID-19 issues. The hospitality and tourism industry face an uncertain future, and this finding underscores the need for hotels to ensure the happiness and safety of guests with health concerns as we adjust to the “new normal”. As the researcher points out, “the current situation in China may present a future scenario for many parts of the world in the coming years”. \nWhat about guests’ readiness for contactless systems? It turned out that delightful experiences had a particularly great positive effect on equity for the low TRI group – the very guests who were most sceptical about new technology. This suggests that it is crucial to offer surprise treats to those who might be wary of even staying in a contactless hotel. With today’s technology, a whole menu of joyful surprises can be imagined. The researchers suggest a few themselves: “the moment customers enter their room, the smart room could have already set their favorite temperature, lighting, and even music”. \nHotels have responded to the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing contactless technology wherever possible. This has increased safety, but potentially at the cost of warmth in customer service. To retain guests, hotel managers need to think creatively about how to optimise their experience in a contactless era. Guests with the lowest technology readiness actually respond best to the unexpected delights that a contactless hotel can offer. Touch-free services are also a promising way to reassure those with strong concerns around infection. \nHao, Fei and Chon, Kaye (2021). Are You Ready for a Contactless Future?

  "text": "Trees, potted plants and “green walls” may not be conventional forms of interior design, but with growing demand for sustainable, eco-friendly hospitality, hotels are upping their efforts to incorporate “green atmospherics” into their indoor spaces. Whilst people’s behaviour is known to be shaped by their physical surroundings, the specific effects of living plants, scent, air quality, natural light and green spaces are not yet known. Focusing on the luxury hotel sector, Professor Jin-Soo Lee of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and co-researchers explored the influence of various dimensions of green atmospherics on the well-being and behavioural intentions of hotel guests and employees. Their findings could help luxury hotel managers deliver a more enjoyable experience for guests and take better care of their employees while also reducing their environmental impact.\nThe hotel sector is a major contributor to pollution, waste and environmental damage. Hotels not only generate large volumes of greenhouse gases, grey water and food waste but also consume substantial natural resources. As the tourism industry continues to grow, so does the need to provide more eco-friendly lodging for travellers. Rising to this challenge, many hotels are making moves to minimise their environmental impact by implementing green initiatives, which simultaneously meet the growing customer demand for sustainable hospitality. Increasingly, the researchers note, “individuals embrace sustainability as not only a design preference, but also a moral code”.\n“Green atmospherics” describes a healthy, eco-friendly physical environment. Hotels keen to foster green atmospherics might furnish their indoor spaces with living trees, potted plants, green rest areas, fresh air, natural light and good ventilation. “Visitors and employees in a hotel are therefore interacting with various elements of its green indoor atmospherics”, say the researchers. According to previous studies, interacting with green and healthy atmospherics can boost guests’ positive experiences of hotels. Indoor atmospherics may influence cognitive, emotional and physical responses as well as behaviours such as retention, loyalty and word-of-mouth intention.\nAccording to the researchers, the beneficial effects of green atmospherics can be explained by the “stimulus organism response theory”, which formed the backdrop of this research. This theory holds that environmental attributes act as stimuli that influence a person’s mental state, which in turn affects their behaviour. “In particular,” say the authors, “environmental psychologists argue that positive behaviours derive from individuals’ well-being and happiness through positive experiences”. Accordingly, green indoor atmospherics are likely to foster positive responses and behaviours in hotel guests.\nIn modern society, the chance to connect with nature is usually joyfully welcomed, with intuitive links to mental well-being. In hotels, green atmospherics are conducive to a positive state of mind that results in a greater sense of well-being. Mental well-being is “a crucial concept for both patrons and workers”, emphasise the authors. For instance, employees are more willing to work in places that promote their well-being. The authors hypothesised that green atmospherics in hotels enhance the mental well-being of both hotel guests and employees.\nIn turn, mental well-being is known to affect decision making and behaviour. Research has found that mental well-being significantly predicts hotel employees’ green behaviour. “Mental well-being brings diverse outcomes that are beneficial to the company”, say the authors. These outcomes can include an enhanced sense of belonging, loyalty and purchase/recommendation intentions and behaviours. Building on these findings, the researchers aimed to determine how mental well-being affects the behavioural intentions of hotel guests and employees.\nFinally, the researchers considered the role of “place dependence”, defined as a sense of deep connection with spaces that meet one’s functional and emotional needs. “Travellers who feel comfortable and familiar with a place are likely to have strong place dependence or attachment and to revisit the place”, explain the authors. Mental well-being has been found to determine place dependence, which can in turn affect customers’ purchase intentions, loyalty, and other behaviours. To explore these connections in greater depth, the researchers investigated the influence of mental well-being on place dependence and how place dependence can in turn affect behavioural intentions in the context of green atmospherics in hotels.\nIn an elegant two-phase experiment, the researchers explored the nuanced relationships between elements of green atmospherics and the well-being, place dependence and behavioural intentions of hotel employees and guests. In Phase 1, focus group discussions with five hotel guests, five hotel employees and three hospitality management professors revealed seven important attributes of green indoor atmospherics, which were assigned to three major categories: green ambient conditions (air quality, scent, natural light), green items (e.g. living plants) and green spaces/areas (e.g. green rest areas).\nPhase 2 was a field survey conducted at luxury hotels in South Korean cities. Over 10 days, 253 hotel guests with a mean age of 35 were recruited from different indoor spaces in their hotels to complete a questionnaire. Data from 247 employees, aged 32.5 on average, were also collected on site from the same luxury hotels. All of the participants completed a questionnaire that measured their mental well-being, place dependence and behavioural intentions.\nA key novel contribution of this study lies in its categorisation of the attributes of green indoor atmospherics in luxury hotels into green ambient conditions, green items and green spaces/areas. The researchers found that these constructs influenced the formation of mental well-being, place dependence and behavioural intentions among hotel guests and hotel employees. Supporting stimulus organism response theory, this finding highlights “the role of green indoor atmospherics in inducing guests’ and employees’ mental well-being perception”, say the researchers, “which leads to increased place dependence and behavioural intentions”.\nMental well-being and place dependence not only directly triggered behavioural intentions but also indirectly influenced behavioural intentions by maximising the influence of green indoor atmospherics. Through targeted efforts to enhance mental well-being and place dependence, say the authors, hotels could optimise their use of green ambient conditions, green items and green spaces/areas. “This will fortify the effect of these concepts in building guest and employee intentions to remain with the hotel, say positive things about the hotel, and have loyalty to the hotel.”\nThe power of green atmospherics to make guests feel healthy and happy, and the pivotal role of mental well-being, highlights a unique opportunity for hotels. “Offering mental well-being to hotel guests and hotel employees is a vital step for the increased intentions to remain with the hotel, say positive things about the hotel, and be loyal to the hotel”, clarify the authors. Managers could diversify their efforts to enhance guests’ and employees’ well-being by, for example, improving social interactions for guests through leisure facility discounts and strengthening social relationships between colleagues through team building activities.\nThe final noteworthy finding is that of the three dimensions of green atmospherics, green ambient conditions most strongly influenced guests’ well-being, whereas these three dimensions had more or less equal effects on the mental well-being of employees. “It is thus essential for luxury hotel proprietors to focus more on fortifying the ambient conditions within the hotel and its performance in order to attain a stronger level of mental well-being among their guests”, note the researchers. Additionally, at a similar level of mental well-being, guests more actively built behavioural intentions than employees did.\nThis insightful study identifies mental well-being as a key driver of the influence of green atmospherics in hotels on behavioural intentions, particularly those of guests. The findings also indicate a clear need to tailor strategies for promoting green atmospherics to different groups. “To effectively enhance mental well-being and behavioural intentions”, conclude the authors, “luxury hotel proprietors should develop and use tactics that are different for guests and for employees”. The insights afforded by this study also have exciting implications for creating green atmospherics in other indoor service settings, such as restaurants and cruise ships.\nHan, Heesup, Lee, Jin-Soo, and Koo, Bonhak (2021).

  "text": "26 October 2022\nAirline Industry in Crisis\nCancelled flights and complicated travel protocols have become all too common amidst the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, whose outbreak all but grounded the global airline industry. However, we still know little about how these new job stressors actually affect airline workers. Shedding light on this important issue, Professor Sam Kim of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and co-researchers identified the major pandemic-related stressors that have emerged for airline workers and explored their effects on workers’ mental health and job-related outcomes such as satisfaction, motivation and performance. The authors’ findings offer invaluable practical guidance for alleviating the worrying knock-on effects of the pandemic on the well-being of airline employees and the growth of the airline industry as a whole.\nIrregular schedules, night shifts, physical exertion and time zone changes are part of life for airline workers. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, however, employees have faced a horde of fresh difficulties. With planes grounded across the world, mass redundancies and restructuring have profoundly increased job insecurity. Safety-related stressors such as sanitisation and mask wearing requirements, along with strict and time-consuming immigration procedures, hotel quarantine and fear of contracting the virus, are now also part of employees’ new routine. “The new types of stressors resulting from the pandemic, as well as traditional stressors, will have many job-related consequences”, warn the researchers.\nMore exposure to stressors means more job-related stress. Studies have found that such stress explains the high prevalence of physical and mental health problems in flight attendants and triggers emotional exhaustion, burnout, depersonalisation and depression in hotel employees. Protecting employees’ mental health – which has been damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic – is not only a major public health issue but also critical to business success. Yet “studies that scrutinise the antecedents of mental health problems and their consequences in the hospitality and tourism industry are still limited”, say the authors. Recognising this, they set out to pinpoint what the major new stressors are for airline workers and how and to what extent they impact mental health and job outcomes.\nThe effects of mental health on job outcomes – such as job satisfaction and job performance – in the hospitality and tourism industry are understudied. Perhaps unsurprisingly, research in other contexts has shown that an unhealthy working environment and work stress decrease job satisfaction. Poor mental health may also worsen job performance. This may in turn generate significant costs for employers, state the researchers, “such as increases in work-related injuries, reduced productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism, and employee compensation claims”. Mental health could also influence employees’ perception of company image, which reflects workplace morale, pride and motivation. People with poor mental health also tend to have “a reduced responsiveness to others’ needs”, which creates obvious problems in the service sector.\nThe researchers also examined the possibility that job satisfaction in turn influences job performance, company images and prosocial behaviour. Job satisfaction has been found to enhance job performance in flight attendants, and to predict more positive perceptions of company image in airline employees. More generally, job satisfaction is thought to increase an individual’s willingness to contribute to the community in the form of pro-social behaviours. But how has job satisfaction affected these work outcomes in airline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic?\nAlso of interest was whether sociodemographic and job-related characteristics alter the relationships between job-related stress, mental health, and job outcomes. For example, during crises like the pandemic, “age may determine contract renewal, layoff, or fringe benefit provision”, say the researchers.\nThe questionnaire used in this study was developed in several careful stages, the first being in-depth interviews with 15 airline employees to better glimpse working conditions before and during the crisis. Insights were used for subsequent creation of the questionnaire. Its 40 items assessed job stressors—including traditional and new stressors—job satisfaction, organisational commitment, perceived company image, job performance and pro-social behaviour. As a final preparatory step, the questionnaire was piloted with 100 Hong Kong airline employees to doublecheck its validity and reliability.\nAfter tweaking, the questionnaire was distributed to 374 Hong Kong airline employees between 15 July and 30 December 2020. Over half of the participants were men (63%), and most were in their 20s or 30s. The vast majority worked for full-service carriers in Hong Kong. More than 75% worked in flight operation departments and 20.9% worked in ground operation departments. Almost half had worked in the airline industry for 10 years or more. With regard to their positions in the airline industry, 46% were at supervisory level, followed by entry-level (43.8%) and managerial level or above (10.2%). The questionnaire responses were analysed to examine the structural relationships between the variables.\nPassenger arrivals at Hong Kong International airport decreased by 98.5% between October 2019 and October 2020. This simple fact could account for the study’s first finding – that traditional job-related stressors did not affect airline employees’ mental health after the COVID-19 outbreak. “When airline employees can perform few of their normal duties, physical exhaustion, schedule conflicts and demanding workloads cannot affect mental health status”, explain the authors. Nevertheless, the pandemic brought with it three significant new stressors: hygiene requirements, safety concerns, and job instability. Of these, safety concerns and job instability significantly impacted mental health.\nThe researchers found that more intense safety concerns were detrimental to mental health. As the researchers note, airline employees’ mental health “is important to enable them to consistently provide high quality service to passengers”. Therefore, overcoming safety concerns could be a decisive strategy. Airlines could follow the example set by Emirates Airline, which has distributed “hygiene kits”, organised individual hotel rooms in outport destinations, and enforced a 14-day quarantine for its employees. More transparency about confirmed cases on specific flights and providing information about safety measures in risky destinations could also reduce concerns.\nQuite unexpectedly, job instability was associated with better mental health. On the face of it, this is mystifying, at odds with pre-pandemic reports that job uncertainty worsens mental health. “Airline crew seemed to feel grateful to retain their jobs in an economic crisis”, infer the authors. Cost-saving measures implemented by an airline could also signal its efforts to ride out hardship “together with its employees”, thus generating positive mental health effects.\nThis important study shed light not only on the factors shaping mental health but also on its consequences: good mental health was found to enhance job satisfaction, job performance, perceived company image, and prosocial behaviours. Job satisfaction also improved job performance, perceived company image and prosocial behaviours. These findings underscore the potentially far-reaching benefits of fostering a healthy working environment and promoting employee satisfaction.\nAirlines wishing to support their employees’ mental health should also note that perceived stressors and their effects differ according to age, sex, job position, and working experience. “Mental health programmes are required to be differently applied according to employees’ career or demographic characteristics”, conclude the authors.\nShedding new light on mental health in airline workers, this work suggests that airlines should eradicate safety concerns as much as possible. Surprisingly, job instability was found to improve workers’ mental health. However, airlines and governments should by no means use this finding as an excuse to overlook the issue, not least because job instability and unemployment are serious problems in Hong Kong. “Cabin crew who have worked for their airline for a long time should be helped to upgrade their skills and know-how to dissipate job stressors during the present unstable business environment in the airline industry”, conclude the researchers.\nKim, Seongseop (Sam), Wong, Antony King Fung, Han, Heesup, and Yeung, Man Wah (Vanessa) (2022).

  "text": "21 November 2022\nStaycationers Behaving Badly\nCOVID-19 has changed how we holiday: out with crowding into airports to fly to distant resorts;in with staying close to home. Although this might seem an effective way to support localtourism while containing the virus, research by Ph.D. student Mr Wilson Au, Dr Nelson Tsangand Dr Clare Fung of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong KongPolytechnic University reveals a downside of “staycationing”. In Hong Kong, manyholidaymakers confined to local hotels during the pandemic have begun to behave badly, taking atoll on staff’s mental health. This timely study highlights the need for hotels to remove incentivesfor staycationers to cause trouble and create an environment that brings out the best in guests.\nEven before the outbreak of COVID-19, staycationing was a growing trend. “Since the early1900s,” the authors note, “many Americans have taken short trips to enjoy summer vacations within their usual place of residence”. Once ignored by tourism researchers, staycationing is nowrecognised as an important market segment. Framing a short-distance trip as a special kind ofvacation can help people see familiar places in a new light. Moreover, in uncertain times,holidaying in your hometown is less vulnerable to disruption and more environmentallysustainable than travelling abroad.\nAs in the West, staycationing has surged in Hong Kong since 2020 because of pandemic-relatedrestrictions on travel and leisure. However, the researchers warn of a dark side to the tourismindustry’s home-grown pandemic solution. Focusing on the Hong Kong hotel sector, theyexplored the interaction between the recent staycation boom and an old problem in hospitality:“jaycustomer” behaviour.“\nThe term ‘jaycustomer’ is a customer-specific form of ‘jaywalker’”, the researchers explain. Itrefers to customers who act antisocially in service settings such as hotels, bars, and airports,making life difficult for staff. Jaycustomer behaviour ranges from the boorish to the criminal,encompassing everything from breaking rules, rudeness to staff, and refusing to settle the bill totheft and even vandalism. Hotels are especially vulnerable to jaycustomer behaviour, say theresearchers, because they are “characterised by a close but short-term service provider–customerrelationship”.\nCombine a jaycustomer and a staycationer and you get a toxic visitor whom the researchers dub a“jaystaycationer”. While staying at hotels in their own cities, jaystaycationers abuse thehospitality of their hosts and cause physical and/or emotional damage. The SHTM team wasinspired by a local example of disorderly guests in 2020. “One large group of staycationers heldwhat was described as ‘a wild birthday party’ at the Peninsula Hong Kong,” report theresearchers, “with stains on every electric device in the room”.\nJaycustomer issues have intensified during the pandemic, partly because travel restrictions haveput businesses in a perilous position. Those who continue to patronise local establishments mayfeel like saviours, giving them the sense of a licence to misbehave. “With such strong perceived bargaining power in the marketplace,” say the researchers, “individuals are less likely to complywith organisational regulations and social norms, which stimulates their jaycustomer behaviors”.Recognising the harm that such hotel guests can cause to other customers, staff and businessoperations, the researchers set out to classify jaystaycationer problems and identify their causesand how staff react.\nThe authors conducted individual telephone interviews with 10 staff members from four- andfive-star hotels in Hong Kong. Had they experienced trouble with staycationers? Under COVID-19 restrictions, the city’s luxury hotels have seen a surge in bookings from Hong Kongers unableor unwilling to travel abroad. However, whilst a foreign guest in normal times would spend mostof their time roaming the city, pandemic staycationers are confined to their hotels almost 24/7.Had staff noticed anything unusually demanding about these guests, the researchers asked, and ifso, what did they think of it?\nStaff responses to guest behaviours are subjective and dependent on the individual. Hence, theauthors were concerned with capturing both their interviewees’ unique personal experiences andthe broader context of social disruption in which these events occurred. Their approach needed tobe objective and rooted in established theory. To meet these demands, they settled onconstructivist grounded theory, a popular framework for obtaining qualitative insights in tourismstudies. This approach enabled them to “highlight the existence of multiple realities and elicit theviews of each participant’s ‘subjective world’”.\nAnalysis of the interviews revealed four types of jaystaycationer. “Attention seekers” and“benefit seekers” were defined by their underlying need to get something from hotel staff.Attention seekers attempted to meet intangible emotional needs by, for example, emphasisinghow virtuous it was for them to support local hotels despite the risk of catching COVID-19.Benefit seekers, taking things further, sought tangible rewards by exploiting hotels’ weakposition during the pandemic to demand free upgrades and special services. A similar distinctionbetween tangible and intangible separated “rule breakers”, who transgressed when theopportunity arose, e.g. by holding large parties, and “property abusers”, who progressed tophysically damaging property by, for example, cooking in their rooms and setting off thesprinkler system.\nPredictably, the spread of COVID-19 was a recurring theme of the interviews. Hotel guests foundways to belittle staff through both under- and over-compliance with safety rules. One interviewee– a housekeeper at a five-star hotel – was made to fear for their safety by the carelessness ofjaystaycationers around face masks: “Staycationers refused to follow our hotel’s policies. Theydid not wear masks and argued with me without their masks on.” In contrast, a front desk officerat another hotel felt dehumanised by the hygiene obsessions of guests checking in:“Jaystaycationers kept using disinfectant spray to clean everything on my desk, such as my pen.It’s so disrespectful; I am not the virus.”\nThe staff responded to these unpleasant guests in several ways, which the researchers categorisedas practical and psychological. In practical terms, they could either stand up to thejaystaycationers or acquiesce, while their emotional reactions ranged from trying to thoughtfully understand their guests’ positions to simply giving up hope or avoiding contact. These findings offer novel insights into the psychological effects of dealing with jaystaycationers. “Threeemotional responses (i.e. sense of thoughtfulness, sense of powerlessness, and self-isolation)”, the researchers report, “may bridge the relationship between jaycustomer behaviors and hotelworkers’ negative responses”.\nFinally, the interviews revealed two types of causes of jaystaycationer behaviour: personal andenvironmental. Jaystaycationers could be motivated by a triad of negative emotions: fear ofCOVID-19, arrogance and greed. Conflict could also arise from three environmental causes: thenature of staycationing (confinement in a hotel almost 24/7), the rules around infection safety(which were new to both guests and staff), and the ambiguity and complexity of the holidaypackages offered to staycationers, which jaystaycationers tried to take advantage of.\nThis last point suggests a possible way to combat the problem. “Instead of just recordingstaycationers’ dining credits internally,” the researchers suggest, “hotel operators could considermaking them transparent for staycationers to monitor on the hotel’s website”.\nAlthough irresponsible customers are nothing new, this is the first study to analyse thejaycustomer problem in the specific context of staycationing. The findings offer actionableinsights for hotels into avoiding environmental triggers of jaystaycationer behaviour. By payingattention, for the first time, to the psychological as well as practical strategies that beleagueredstaff use to cope with this problem, the study may also help hotel owners take better care of theiremployees during stressful periods such as pandemics. This preliminary study points the way to adeeper understanding of the causes and consequences of a crucial emerging problem inhospitality.\nAu, Wai Ching Wilson, Tsang, Nelson K.

He also serves as a Director of Sir Elly Kadoorie & Sons Ltd., and holds a number of trusteeships and directorships in other public and private companies. In addition to his business activities, he is involved in the Kadoorie Agricultural Aid Association in Nepal.\nThroughout his career, Sir Michael has received many honours and medals from countries such as France, Belgium, and the UK, where he was bestowed a Knights Bachelor by Her Majesty The Queen. He has also been awarded several honorary doctorates, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by The University of Hong Kong and an honorary Doctor of Science degree by The Imperial College in London.\nThe Kadoorie family has always believed in making a profound contribution to the social and economic wellbeing of their fellow citizens, in return for the generous opportunities afforded to them, and Sir Michael is no exception. In 2007, he founded the Hong Kong Heritage Project to locate and collect documents and photographs from CLP, HSH, and the Kadoorie Family, and to make them available to researchers and the general public. The Project has unearthed many records relating to Hong Kong society at large, and has also created an oral history programme – one of the largest collections in Hong Kong.\nSir Michael has made enduring contributions to both the commercial and philanthropic sectors of the hospitality industry. The success and expansion of the Peninsula Group within HSH owes much to his keen personal interest in all aspects of the Group's work and especially with the location and design of new hotels. He translates this same energy to ensuring that greater opportunities are made available to the disadvantaged. The Kadoorie Charitable Foundation's funding of hospitality training schemes in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos owes much to Sir Michael's vision, as does the successful Hong Kong hospitality training scheme for young people who were not able to write or read Chinese. In fact, this programme was so successful that the Education Bureau adopted and now funds the scheme, which is still running today.\nIn Shanghai, Sir Michael established the Sir Horace Kadoorie Youth Development Centre for Hospitality, which targets migrant and disadvantaged youth in China. This two-year course, run with the assistance of the Peninsula Hotel in Shanghai, provides graduates with all the necessary training to enter the job market. The first course graduated in May of this year.\nAlthough Sir Michael has many business commitments and responsibilities and is actively involved in a wide programme of philanthropic funding, it is his passion for hospitality in each of these fields that singles him out as one of Hong Kong's foremost and visionary hoteliers.",

  "text": "Mr. John Drummond is General Manager, Intercontinental Grand Stanford Hong Kong. His proposer, Ms. Akniyet Nygmet, currently a year-2 hotel management student stated in her nomination:\n“ … John is the first person I always call upon whenever I am hesitating to make an industry-related decision. Just like all hotel managers, he is very busy, especially during covid recovery nowadays. Yet he always manages to find time in his busy schedule for me. This shows how John honors his responsibility as a mentor. \nAfter every meeting I have with John, I get very hopeful about my career life. He always tells me “When there is passion, there is progress. What is meant to be yours will never go away from you.” John was passionate about cooking. From a young age he cooked, first in a home setting, then in a hotel, for 30 years. Years ago he was offered a promotion from chef to the position of general manager of the hotel. He was so passionate about the kitchen that many times he declined the promotion offer. He was not seeking the better position, but the better position was seeking him. When he was telling this story, I was already “dreaming strategically” of how I was mounting from a position of guest relations agent to front office manager, then became a hotel manager. This is how effective his insightful stories are. This is how a mentor should manipulate a mentee’s mind. \nJohn is not a mere mentor who limits the conversations to professional topics. Even as a person he is a great one. He knows how to support and inspire confidence, just like a friend. I remember when he supported my decision to settle in the Middle East and even shared tips on how to reach out straightly to general managers. I especially love how he tells me to take everything easy. Seems like a banal sharing of a friend, but hearing it from a hotel leader feels different. This is mostly how he comforts me when I am suffering indecisiveness. To conclude, John Drummond is an industry professional who deserves to be nominated for the Outstanding SHTM Student Mentor Award.”",

As my mentor, Mr. Kwong provided me with great insights of the industry, particularly the airline industry. He shared with me with his journey in the industry, where he started as a junior officer.

Mr. Muller had no obligation to interact so often with me, Mr. Muller had no commitment to know me as a person and not only as a student. I could have never imagined by any stretch of imagination that he would mean so much for me. Every meeting that we had inspired me to learn more valuable information about the field. By the end of our conversations, I was full of energy and ideas for my future career. He was one of the few people who truly believed in my ideas and gave me advice on the business plan I shall work on in the coming future.\nImportant to mention, last summer when the situation in Hong Kong was reaching its pinnacle, he would regularly check on me and make sure that I, as a young person, was in a safe place. He went as far as accommodating me and one of my friends in the SkyCity Marriott so that he would be reassured about my safety and so we would fly back safely to our home country. This visit to the hotel was very beneficial for me. I had a chance to experience the working process of the general manager of Marriott. I have noticed his professionalism in his communication with guests and co-workers. This event itself embodies perfectly the great individual that he is: a gentleman with a great heart and a genuine sense of responsibility. Ever Since that event, I regularly think back about that event and realize that is why I choose this field myself: To serve people as if they are my family.\nMichael Muller was not just my mentor for this year; he became my teacher, my friend and eventually a father figure. Therefore, I could not think of a better kind of person with such is candor and guidance to be nominated for the mentor award.",

For example, Yvonne has given me numerous advice on how to communicate wisely with clients and colleagues as well as my presentation skills. The one-month internship in Eighty 20 Marketing Agency allowed me to work far from home in Finland where I was undertaking my exchange programme. That was a wonderful experience being my first step to understand the real life marketing industry and explore the real world before graduation.\nAt the beginning of the mentorship programme, I was in Finland. Hence, we tried to meet up online every two weeks. After online meetings, Yvonne gave me some special tasks to understand myself more by ,for example, setting short/ long term goals for my future career and conducting SWOT analysis etc. Yvonne is a calm and attentive mentor who can always point out my weakness. Not forget to mention with, she always gives me chance to learn from mistakes such as helping her make reports, marketing proposals or even planning small events for her clients. \nI have had different mentorship experiences, which’re really nice.

Her proposer, Ms. Winnie Siu, Front Office Manager of Marco Polo Hotels Hong Kong complimented that:\n“It is with great pleasure that I write this to nominate Miss Yana Fomenko for the Outstanding SHTM Mentee Award 2022. I believe that Yana is the best choice for the award because, in my opinion, she exemplifies what a mentee should be: a self-motivated individual who is fully committed to personal and professional growth. As a mentor, I have been following her development for one year. During that time, she has consistently demonstrated a full commitment to this programme.\nTwo years ago, Yana decided to seek a career change from modelling to the hospitality industry. When she entered the Mentorship Programme, she was been able to identify the skills, knowledge and goals that she wanted to achieve and communicated them to me during our meetings.\nShe has committed to meeting with me on a regular basis. The first meetings were done on Zoom due to the Covid situation. Later we were able to meet face to face. These meetings also included more informal settings such as a dinner at a restaurant or after a yoga class we took together. These meeting allowed me to learn more about her as a person. She impressed me with traits like humility, passion, honesty, and resilience. During our numerous conversations, she has shown herself to be an international-minded person with a positive outlook and attitude who is eager and open to learn proactively. This was particularly apparent when I gave her a tour of my hotel. Yana had expressed a strong desire to learn Front Office operation. She asked many pertinent and sensible questions that showed her interest and eagerness to learn. She was not only curious about front-of-house procedures, but also back-of-house details. This demonstrates that Yana is proactive in requesting feedback and ready to take onboard the advice given.\nYana demonstrated her ability to plan her development. She worked with me to seek resources for learning by identifying people and information that might be helpful. An example of this is when she had decided to apply for a Front Office Internship. It must be said that it was not an easy feat to secure several interviews in the current competitive environment in. She reached out to me for advice to prepare for the interviews she had lined up. When we practiced together for the interviews with role-plays and Q&A sessions, she showed that she feels comfortable receiving objective and constructive feedback. \nWhenever she asked for advice or help, she has shown herself to be patient, responsive and respectful of my role and time.\nI strongly endorse Yana’s nomination for the Outstanding SHTM Mentee Award 2022 and believe that her ability to take full advantage of opportunities to learn as well as her willingness to be stretched out of her comfort zone make her the best candidate for the award ... “",

His proposer, Mr. Rory Slater, General Manager of The Hari Hong Kong complimented that:\nStella and I made our email introductions swiftly after first being assigned and scheduled a zoom call at the end of February 2021. At the beginning of our relationship I set clear expectations about the structure of our time together. I would offer her time every month but she would need to be proactive to follow up to set the meetings with me directly or my assistant. Stella would need an agenda for each meeting and have questions to ask or topics to discuss. Since then we met consistently on monthly basis for constructive meetings. Stella showed a very positive and proactive attitude which to her credit, has helped her explore the hospitality industry and built a growth mindset.\nIn order to provide as many learning opportunities as possible, our discussions were mainly conducted at The Hari Hong Kong. It was effective to meet learning objectives that we made together in the beginning of this program. \nWe had a hotel tour during her first introduction, she observed the frontline working atmosphere, and also tried our Italian and Japanese restaurants. In addition, she shared the knowledge and ideas learned from professors, and thus we had further productive conversations based on actual data from the Hari. Stella impressed me as she proved she understood data, was able to analyse it quickly and was familiar with many hotel industry practices and terminology. Additionally, Stella became a part-timer in the Italian restaurant ‘Lucciola’ during summer months, which was a perfect way to apply theories into practice in a luxury hotel property as her wish. This experience helped her to become familiar with a local working environment, and she quickly learned Cantonese. Moreover, she thinks ahead. Stella was well planned to consider and discuss with me her numerous options for the next step in her career after graduation. She has the drive and determination to go after the best companies in her chosen field. She has charm, tenacity, confidence and direction so it was not a surprise when she was accepted to be s summer intern at Richemont, where she was subsequently offered a working opportunity after her graduation. \nApart from being proud of Stella’s achievements in 2021, I know she is an outstanding student. Stella is a high potential managerial candidate who whilst instinctively knowing the difference between right and wrong is learning about workplace politics and remains delightfully humble. I can feel she values the chance to engage in this mentorship program. For each meeting, she was prepared with questions and topics that could be discussed and I was always glad to share my experiences for her. After the meeting she was always grateful and wrapped up to be sure of the correct understanding. I believe she made good decisions with the help of the program and I have been pleased to be a small part of her growth this year. I look forward to remaining in contact with her in her career now and in the future.",

  "text": "On 28 April 2023, the SHTM announced the results of a study entitled \"A Decision Support System for Post-COVID Tourism Policy Formation and Monitoring.\" The study developed a cloud-based social listening platform, TOUROMETER, to measure Hong Kong residents' sentiment towards visitors and tourism development and visitors' sentiment towards Hong Kong tourism.\nInstead of using traditional measures to estimate support for tourism, such as those that classify attitudes as positive or negative, this study used a more refined concept – ambivalence – which can capture positive and negative views that are simultaneously held by an individual. TOUROMETER is thus a tool that policymakers can use to monitor the ambivalence of relevant stakeholders towards tourists and tourism development, and is also an effective channel by which to garner public engagement to achieve collaborative planning.\nLed by Professor Cathy Hsu, Principal Investigator and SHTM Chair Professor, the study was funded by the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme, Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office. The study employed rigorous research methods, including analyses of longitudinal news and social media big data through meta-learning algorithms and statistical modelling using economic, environmental, tourism and census data.\nOver the last 4 years, the unprecedented challenges of social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic have substantially disrupted Hong Kong tourism. These challenges, however, provide opportunities to review past experience and thereby improve policymaking in preparation for future problems. In particular, policies aimed at attracting tourists from mainland China, the dominant source market representing 78% of arrivals to Hong Kong in 2018, and spearheading a healthy post-COVID-19 tourism recovery deserve holistic consideration. The massive influx of mainland Chinese tourists since the launch of the Individual Visit Scheme in 2003 has facilitated the exponential growth of tourism. However, it has simultaneously placed a heavy burden on local people, intensifying tensions between Hong Kong residents and mainland tourists. A lesson to be learnt is that understanding and monitoring the sentiment of both residents and visitors is critical for the development of effective policies and timely changes to prevent the occurrence of detrimental and insoluble conflicts.\nTOUROMETER offers a public policy decision-support system to understand public opinion in a timely and continuous manner. The study team collected sentiment data of Hong Kong residents and mainland Chinese tourists on popular social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Ctrip) and 19 major Hong Kong newspapers from 2003 onwards. The results were as follows.\n(1) The dispositions of Hong Kong residents in news stories substantially differ from their dispositions in social media posts. For example, the existence of positive news stories about a given topic does not necessarily mean that there exist positive social media posts about the topic. In general, residents' disposition on social media is less positive and more ambivalent towards mainland Chinese tourists and tourism development than that found in the news.\n(2) Hong Kong residents' disposition towards Hong Kong tourism development is significantly correlated with their disposition towards mainland Chinese tourists. The more ambivalent residents are towards mainland Chinese tourists, the more ambivalent they are towards tourism development.\n(3) The economy, environment and quality of life have significant effects on Hong Kong residents' dispositions towards mainland Chinese tourists and tourism development. Specifically, the higher the GDP per capita and the higher the level of air pollution, the less positive and the more ambivalent residents are towards mainland Chinese tourists; however, the higher the unemployment rate, the more positive and the less ambivalent residents are towards mainland Chinese tourists and tourism development.\n(4) Mainland Chinese tourists' perception of Hong Kong tourism is significantly correlated with Hong Kong's economy and environment and residents' sentiment. The better the economy and environment, the more positive is the tourists' perception of Hong Kong tourism; however, the more negative the residents' sentiment, the less positive is the tourists' perception of Hong Kong tourism.\nIt is therefore important to balance the interests of residents and tourists to achieve social sustainability. TOUROMETER is a useful tool for various tourism stakeholders, as it enables individuals' opinions to be collected in a timely manner to inform public policies. It also enables industry practitioners to recognise social issues and manage risks and opportunities effectively, and allows the government to monitor public opinion holistically and formulate or amend policies efficiently. When sentiment trends below an acceptable level, policies can be devised or revised to address the underlying problems. The factors identified as influencing residents' and tourists' perceptions of Hong Kong tourism should also be monitored. Appropriate policies can then be implemented to cultivate positive sentiment and reduce negative sentiment.\nWith the reopening of the border between Hong Kong and mainland China, Hong Kong's tourism industry is welcoming spring after a long winter. Now is the time to balance the interests of various stakeholders to achieve long-term competitiveness, because when hosts are happy, guests are happy. This study provides a unique tool and important information that will enhance the ability of the government of Hong Kong to support the sustainable development of its tourism industry. The SHTM is proud to support the development of the tourism industry in this manner.",

  "text": "香港理工大學（理大）酒店及旅遊業管理學院今日（四月二十八日）發表《新冠疫後旅遊發展政策制定及監測的決策支持系統》研究項目結果。此項研究發展出一個名為TOUROMETER 的社交媒體聆聽平台，衡量香港居民對旅客和旅遊發展的觀感，以及旅客對香港旅遊的態度。\n在評估對旅遊業的支持程度時，傳統的衡量標準是將態度分為「積極」或「消極」，而此研究項目則引入了一個更精確的概念——矛盾心理，以掌握同時持有積極和消極觀點的心理狀態。該平台為政策制定者提供了一個監測相關持份者複雜心態的決策工具，也為公眾參與協同規劃提供了一個有效途徑。\n此研究項目由理大酒店及旅遊業管理學院講座教授徐惠群教授領導的研究團隊負責，並由香港特別行政區政策創新與統籌辦事處的公共政策研究計劃資助，採用了嚴謹的研究方法，通過機器學習分析新聞及社交媒體大數據，以及使用經濟、環境、旅遊和人口普查的數據進行統計學建模。\n過去四年的社會動盪和新冠疫情給香港旅遊業帶來了前所未有的挫折。然而，危機也是轉機，這些挑戰意味著政策制定者有機會回顧過去的經驗，以闡明未來更有效的決策。特別是吸引內地旅客的政策值得全面考慮，內地旅客佔 2018 年香港入境旅客的 78%，是佔主導地位的客源市場，該市場的相關政策對疫情後旅遊業的健康復甦尤為重要。徐教授表示：「自2003年個人遊計劃推出以來，大量內地旅客的湧入促進了旅遊業的指數級增長，但同時也給當地生活增加了沉重的負擔，加劇了香港居民與內地旅客之間的緊張關係。因此，了解並隨時追蹤香港居民和旅客的情緒，能有效制定和及時修正旅遊發展政策，以避免不可逆轉的衝突。」\n作為公共政策決策支持系統，TOUROMETER 能夠及時、持續地傾聽公眾的聲音。該平台收集了社交媒體平台（如推特和攜程）和香港十九家主要報紙自 2003 年起關於香港居民和內地旅客的情緒數據。結果表明：\n(1) 香港居民在新聞和社交媒體上表現出的情感有顯著差異。新聞的態度積極並不一定意味著社交媒體的態度積極。總的來說，與新聞相比，居民在社交媒體上對內地旅客和旅遊業發展的態度更不積極、心態更矛盾。\n(2) 香港居民對香港旅遊發展的態度與其對內地旅客的態度顯著相關。香港居民對內地旅客的態度越矛盾，對旅遊發展的態度就越矛盾。\n(3) 經濟、環境和生活質量顯著影響香港居民對內地旅客和旅遊業發展的態度。具體而言，人均 GDP 越高，空氣污染越嚴重，香港居民對內地旅客的態度越不積極、心態越矛盾；相反，失業率越高，對內地旅客和旅遊業發展越積極、越不矛盾。\n(4) 內地旅客對香港旅遊的看法與香港經濟、環境和居民情緒顯著相關。香港的經濟和環境越好，旅客對香港的觀感越積極；香港居民對內地旅客的態度越消極，大陸旅客對香港的印象就越不好。\n因此，平衡居民和旅客的關係對實現社會可持續發展具有重要意義。TOUROMETER 適時為旅遊業的各持份者提供了一個有用的工具，使個人意見能被及時聽取以影響公共政策制定；旅遊行業能夠識別社會問題並有效管理風險和把握機遇；並同時讓政策制定者得以全面監察民意，及時制定或修訂政策。當社會情緒低於可接受的水平時，更可以制定或修改政策以應對問題，同時監測影響居民和旅客看法的因素，採取適當的政策措施，培育積極情緒，減少消極情緒。\n與內地重新通關後，香港旅遊業在經歷了漫長的寒冬後迎來了春天。這是一個平衡各持份者利益以獲得長期競爭力的好時機。徐教授說：「這項研究為香港政府提供了重要的信息，以支持香港旅遊業的可持續發展。我們很自豪能夠以此重要的方式支持旅遊業的發展。」\n理大酒店及旅遊業管理學院講座教授兼首席研究員徐惠群教授發表《新冠疫後旅遊發展政策制定及監測的決策支持系統》研究項目結果。\n研究團隊成員(左起)陳楠博士、曾穎歡博士、徐惠群教授、譚國雄先生及詹紫陽先生與學院院長田桂成教授(右三)合影。\n***** \n關於理大酒店及旅遊業管理學院\n四十多年來，理大酒店及旅遊業管理學院為酒店及旅遊教育重新定位，成為世界頂尖的酒店與旅遊教育學府。學院在2022上海軟科世界一流學科排名的「旅遊休閒管理」類別中連續六年位列全球第一，在2021/2022大學學術表現排名的「商業、管理、旅遊業及服務學科」領域中連續五年位居榜首，在2017世界大學排名中心的「酒店、休閒、體育與旅遊」類別中排名世界首位，並在2023 QS 世界大學排名的「酒店管理」類別中連續七年於大學為本課程全球排名第二，是卓越教育的象徵，印證了學院為酒店及旅遊發展開創新紀元的座右銘。\n通過推動教育與傳授知識以服務業界及學術組織是學院的使命，亦是其前進的動力。學院擁有由九十多位具有不同文化背景的學者組成的強大國際團隊，提供由學士學位至博士程度的優質課程。唯港薈是學院別樹一幟的教學及研究酒店，亦是其實踐酒店與旅遊教育範式轉變的重要部分。學院致力提高教育、學習及研究的水準，啟發新一代充滿熱誠及銳意進取的專業人才，培育他們成為未來酒店及旅遊業的領袖。",

  "text": "Hospitality is one of the fastest growing and most dynamic sectors of global business, and its professionals require a 21st century skill set to stay competitive. In a world that has become very connected, it is vital for future leaders to have strong international perspectives and an in-depth understanding of the cultural immersion that is key to the global hospitality business.\nAt the forefront of the industry, the SHTM has anticipated this demand and formed a unique alliance with two world-class centres of educational excellence, Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne and the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management at the University of Houston, to establish the tripartite Master of Science (MSc) in Global Hospitality Business programme. This is the first time that these three institutions, representing the best of the East and West, have collaborated to help define the future of global hospitality development. \nThis innovative educational strategy will allow students from Europe, Asia and North America to spend one semester in each of the three continents, capitalising on three outstanding faculties and campuses. The ground-breaking programme features:\n\"Glocal\" Expertise\nIn small classes of about thirty, students will begin their curriculum in Switzerland at the EHL, then move to the SHTM in Hong Kong for their second semester, spend three months in residence with an international hospitality company and finally complete their third semester at the Hilton College in Houston, Texas. \nUnparalleled Professional Immersion\nFour to five day workshops will allow students to receive insights from hospitality professionals and complete reports covering competitive analysis, market study, property performance review, feasibility study, impact analysis and/or pipeline development analysis with live industry data, gaining practical, real-life exposure. \nBusiness Field Trips\nEach semester, students will participate in Business Field Trips to tourism hubs on each continent, where they will gain the exclusive chance to meet and hold discussions with the major local players in the field. \nCapstone Projects\nStudents will be assigned a Capstone project to complete throughout the programme. Assembled in small teams and coached by our experts, students will act as consultants to global companies, including during three months at company headquarters. This will be a unique opportunity for corporations to obtain insights from multinational, driven young professionals.\nA Memorable Experience\nThe programme will offer students eighteen months of intense courses, challenging projects, cultural immersion, motivating interactions, notable contacts and global travel.\nProfessional Certification\nUpon graduation, students of this exceptional programme will receive the MSc in Global Hospitality Business degree awarded by PolyU and Certificates of Completion issued by the EHL and UH.\nApplications will be accepted until 30 April 2015.

  "text": "The SHTM has been working in close collaboration with the international wine industry to develop a distinctive programme, the Master of Science (MSc) in International Wine Management, to groom the next generation of global industry leaders.\nAt a recent media briefing, Professor Kaye Chon, Dean and Chair Professor of the SHTM and Walter Kwok Foundation Professor in International Hospitality Management, noted that as a key player in the vibrant international wine scene, Hong Kong offers a unique location for anyone aspiring to be a part of this dynamic growth area. Combined with the huge growth of the wine market in mainland China, the need for wine professionals with advanced, specialised education and a global perspective continues to grow. The MSc in International Wine Management has been designed to meet this demand.\nOffered in Hong Kong by the SHTM, the programme is the first-of-its-kind in the region. Professor Haiyan Song, Associate Dean of the SHTM and Programme Leader, explained that there is increasing demand for wine trade personnel in Asia, but there is no other Master's programme to enhance professional competence and strategic thinking. He also noted that recent findings in Hong Kong indicate that the wine industry requires more sophisticated skills to meet the needs of the international wine market, with 57.2% of full-time staff taking up positions at managerial and supervisory levels. However, only 5.2% of local industry practitioners possess wine-related professional qualifications. \nThis one-of-a-kind programme will groom industry leaders, educators and researchers by deepening their understanding of the latest trends in the wine business, demystifying its complexities, and empowering them to lead the industry's future development. Students will also have the opportunity to learn more about mainland Chinese wine consumers and gain insights into some of the fastest growing, potentially lucrative wine markets in the world. \nThe programme was developed in consultation with noted wine industry figure Professor Jeannie Cho Lee, Professor of Practice (Wine) at the SHTM and the first Asian Master of Wine, and has been endorsed by renowned industry leaders. It will feature residential study trips to well-known wine regions such as Burgundy or Bordeaux so students can understand the best practice in wine production, trade and management with a view to increasing their international exposure and developing global networks. Professor Lee observed that as it is based in the heart of the booming Asia-Pacific region, the SHTM is best placed to provide international education to meet the specific demands of a truly global industry.\nTo be launched in the 2015/16 academic year, this new MSc programme will be available in both full-time and part-time modes.\nApplications will be accepted until 30 April 2015.

  "text": "What is the hotel room of the future? How does it appeal to the next generation of connected world travellers? The SHTM and Hotel ICON are striving to find out with their designated rooms for research and development - \"Tomorrow's Guestrooms\".\nFollowing the success of the technology-themed first round of the competition last year, the SHTM recently announced design as the theme of the second round. The \"Tomorrow's Guestrooms Design Competition - The Hotel Room of the Future\" is being held from 1 September 2014 to 31 January 2015. \nAt a media briefing held last month, Professor Kaye Chon, SHTM Dean and Co-Chairman of the competition, said that with the emergence of \"experience economy\", hotel guests are demanding stays that deliver unique high-touch experiences related to aspects of comfortable design in terms of furnishing and amenities, wellbeing and technology.\nMr Richard Hatter, General Manager of Hotel ICON and the competition's other Co-Chairman, added that Hotel ICON appeals to the next generation of connected world travellers who blend work and play, demand style and substance, and are technologically savvy. According to studies conducted in the US, millennials are likely to spend more on travel than any other age group over the next 12 months, and will spend drastically more than previous generations. The SHTM and Hotel ICON are looking to cater to this extremely sophisticated generation by designing a room for the future within the confines of a typical Hotel ICON room. \nProfessional and young architects, architecture studios and other businesses in the industry as well as design students from tertiary education institutions around the world have been invited to submit proposals individually or as teams to showcase their visions of hotel room design for guests of the future. \nEntries will be reviewed by an expert panel, and will be judged on functionality in design and creativity in implementation. The winners will have the chance to have their design realised in the designated Tomorrow's Guestrooms at Hotel ICON. The student winner will also be given the opportunity to develop their design during a mentoring internship at Conran and Partners in London.\nDr Basak Denizci Guillet, SHTM Associate Professor and Co-ordinator of the Tomorrow's Guestrooms project, observed that Hotel ICON is in many ways a project of the future as it educates the professionals that will lead the industry in the years to come. The Tomorrow's Guestrooms Design Competition will provide not only valuable insights into the hotel room of the future, but also an excellent opportunity for current and future hoteliers and young designers to understand the desires, needs and expectations of a very sophisticated generation. \nFor further details and applications, please visit: http://shtm.polyu.edu.hk/tgr.",

  "text": "Women in Leadership in Hospitality Mini-Forum Held at the SHTM \nAs more women are being elevated into leadership roles, it is important to understand the unique qualities and abilities they bring to the workplace. Organised by the SHTM and held at its premises on 20 October 2014, the Women in Leadership in Hospitality Mini-Forum brought together distinguished executives from Hong Kong's hospitality industry who shared with participants the impact that female leadership has on creating career paths for growth in the industry. While these women leaders already fill senior roles, they are forging the way for other talented leaders.\nThe SHTM had the pleasure of inviting four such leaders to speak at the mini-forum.\nA legendary hotelier, Ms Rainy Chan joined The Peninsula Hong Kong as the Front Office Manager.

  "text": "Supporting sustainable tourism development is one of the SHTM's key priorities. Recently, SHTM academics participated in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and service learning activities in Mongolia and Cambodia with that aim in mind. \nThe SHTM's Dr Jinsoo Lee and Dr Steve Pan visited Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in mid-July to serve as volunteer lecturers and design a hospitality and tourism management curriculum for Mongolia International University (MIU). A private university founded by a Korean missionary in 2001, MIU is the only tertiary institution in the country with English as the medium of instruction. With tuition fees from 800 students as its only source of income and situated in an area with long severe winters, the university struggles to attract and retain staff. It has 48 staff members across eight departments, with only one in the Department of Hotel and Restaurant Management. \nDr Lee and Dr Pan boosted that number from 15 to 26 July, delivering daily three-hour lectures on urban tourism. Attracting 31 students from various years who were very eager to learn, the lectures were highly interactive and featured an encouraging level of student participation. \nIn a similar effort over summer, the SHTM's Mr Raymond Kwong, Mr Martin Bugler and Dr Pearl Lin provided assistance in curriculum design and teaching material editing for the Horizons Vocational Training Institute in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Established by an Irish Catholic nun to assist victims of human trafficking, the Institute prepares students for better lives with food and beverage job skills. \nAlso in Cambodia, Dr Alan Wong and Ms Chloe Lau led a group of 50 PolyU students, including two from the SHTM, on a service learning visit from 13 to 21 June. Organised by the Office of Service Learning and Department of Computing, and as part of the \"Technology Beyond Borders\" course, two teams of students engaged children in the technological opportunities on offer in the twenty-first century. \nOne team, led by Dr Wong, visited a primary school in the Sen Sok district of Phnom Penh to conduct a computer camp. The students mainly taught their young charges computer literacy. They also set up a mobile computer \"Lab in a Suitcase\" in a TukTuk, a type of auto-rickshaw common in Cambodia, and trained local volunteers in maintaining the equipment and supporting the children in their learning. \nMs Lau led the other team of students to the Happy Tree Community Development Centre elsewhere in Phnom Penh, where they painted a wall and conducted video interviews and a survey with households in the surrounding slum. The data collected were deemed useful for NGO in identifying the needs of the villagers. The students also set up a server for e-books at the House of Rainbow Bridge Hospice Orphanage, a home for HIV+/AIDS-affected children. While at the orphanage they taught the children how to use computer applications, such as the Scratch language used for basic animation, how to tell stories using stop-motion animation, and introduced them to basic concepts in robotics and blogging. \nThe SHTM is proud of all these efforts, and will continue to use its expertise to help those in need towards better futures.",

  "text": "On 17 September, the SHTM announced the findings of a study on \"Enhancing the Role of the Travel Trade in Reducing Tourism's Carbon Footprint\". The study found that although the senior management and owners of travel agencies are aware of tourism's contribution to carbon emissions, the limited provision of carbon efficient products hinders their frontline staff from promoting low carbon tourism to their clients. Likewise, while frontline travel trade staff members are very concerned about environmental issues, many feel ill-equipped or qualified to provide clients with knowledgeable suggestions. \nFunded by the Council for Sustainable Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government, the study was conducted by a team led by Assistant Professor, Dr Barry Mak and joined by Professor Bob McKercher. Targeting frontline travel trade staff members in Hong Kong the team had the goal of developing a series of professional development programmes to enhance their knowledge, awareness and understanding of tourism's contribution to climate change and how they, as key informants, can influence tourist behaviour. The SHTM has observed that Hong Kong's travel trade is generally unaware of its contribution to carbon emissions and the global climate change issue. As travel agents and tour operators in Hong Kong are considered key informants in tourism, it is important to help them develop their awareness so that they can play an active role in providing relevant advice and shaping tourists' travel behaviour.\nThe study was conducted in two stages. Stage one involved in-depth interviews with the owners and senior management of travel agencies in Hong Kong, and with representatives from the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong (TIC) along with detailed questionnaires sent to over 600 frontline outbound travel trade staff members. Senior management and owners believed that tourism contributes significantly to climate change, and that the sector has a role to play in its mitigation. However, they indicated that suppliers should also be expected to provide more carbon-efficient products, and that the government should take the lead in tackling the issue. \nAmong the 632 questionnaires received, the vast majority of the respondents (86.6%) had not received any formal training related to climate change, carbon emissions or their responsibilities as travel trade professionals. More than half of the respondents (59.3%) were concerned about environmental issues and familiar with the terminology associated with climate change, despite readily admitting that their knowledge was limited. A few (16.6%) reported having profound knowledge of climate change and only 2.1% indicated a deep understanding of the issue. \nThe study also found that the frontline travel trade staff members' low awareness and lack of knowledge resulted in ill-informed opinions about climate change and tourism's role in it. Many frontline staff members felt unqualified to inform clients and thus saw the need for formal training in this regard.\nIn the second stage of the project, travel agencies' owners, senior management members and frontline travel trade staff members were invited to training workshops at which they were introduced to various tactics and strategies for developing their knowledge. \nThe SHTM believes that this sort of training must begin by creating awareness about climate change and establishing its significance for tourism - emphasising frontline staff members' ability to make a difference. Staff members must discover the range of actions available to them as they educate themselves about how to play a more proactive role in encouraging clients to modify their behaviour. Furthermore, senior management will need to be more active in raising the climate change issue with suppliers.\nThe project team has developed a digitalised educational toolkit comprising the topics and findings introduced in the training workshops, along with the tactics and strategies offered. This toolkit will be provided to the TIC for their future use in conducting similar training workshops for other stakeholders and industry members. \nThe development of this toolkit contributes to the sustainable development of the travel trade industry, not only in Hong Kong but also worldwide.",

Presented by Dr Fred Mayo of New York University, each workshop spanned four days, with an examination on the fifth. The first workshop was exclusively for SHTM faculty members and postgraduate students, whereas the second workshop was for hospitality educators from Hong Kong and overseas. Nineteen participants attended the first workshop and twenty-five attended the second.\nIn both workshops, the participants had the opportunity to network with other educators as they discussed and practised the latest global teaching principles and skills that provide the best educational experience for hospitality students.\nWhile all hospitality educators can benefit from the continuing education and professional development offered through the CHE programme, its focus on interactive teaching skills is especially useful for instructors who come from a strong industry background.\nAfter completing the CHE requirements, participants earn certification from the American Hotel and Lodging Association's Educational Institute. The Certified Hospitality Educator designation recognises those individuals who have demonstrated the qualities needed to become effective hospitality educators. It is prized by hospitality educators worldwide because it helps to build their reputation for classroom excellence.\nThe SHTM is proud to have been associated with the Educational Institute of the American Hotel and Lodging Association in offering CHE Workshops since 2003.",

Central to the programme is an international focus that recognises the importance of hospitality in the Asia-Pacific region. Its participant-centred teaching and learning methods and flexible delivery pattern will enable industry executives to set their own pace in completing subjects and developing their skills in this fast-changing world.\nThe first cohort of students comprises seasoned hospitality executives who bring with them a wealth of industry experience and knowledge. They see learning as a way to recharge their minds with knowledge and their hearts with passion. As networking is another important aspect in the EM programme, students will find that they are offered rare opportunities to come together and bond. For these industry elites, the programme is serving as an excellent platform for in-depth discussions of the issues that are most relevant to their careers. \nIndeed, increasing competitiveness within the hospitality industry is pushing firms to seek ever more adaptable senior executives who can enhance the competitive advantages of their organisations. The EM programme offered by the SHTM is a stepping stone to the top tiers of this exciting industry!\nTo find out more about the programme, please contact Programme Leader Dr Basak Denizci Guillet at basak.denizci@polyu.edu.hk or visit www.polyu.edu.hk/htm/em.",

Together, they provided a complete picture of ESG concepts in the industry.\nThe first module, \"Caring for the Environment\", was delivered by Dr Deniz Kucukusta, SHTM Associate Professor, who covered the principles and concepts in environmental sustainability and illustrated how the industry was switching to renewable energy with the objective of a carbon-neutral future. Using examples of good practices, Dr Kucukusta also explained how the industry is dealing with waste, encouraging healthy lifestyles, and improving air quality.\nIn the second module, Dr Sebastian Filep, SHTM Assistant Dean, focused on \"Creating a Positive Impact on Society\". Dr Filep covered the key concepts of this important topic, such as corporate social responsibility, positive organisational scholarship and the latest trends in supporting the well-being of tourism and hospitality stakeholders. Dr Filep also illustrated how positive relationships with the community contribute to the success of a business.\nThe programme ended with a third module, \"Upholding Good Governance\", which was presented by Dr Michael Lin, SHTM Assistant Professor. Dr Lin covered the handling of global and local issues in governance, such as anti-corruption, data security, and risk management. Dr Lin also explored with participants the oversight of ESG and the need to keep society informed of how the industry was faring in ESG.\nThe School is very proud to have organised this important programme in collaboration with Hotel ICON, its teaching and research hotel, and HSMAI Asia Pacific.

  "text": "Having recently completed the SHTM-HVS Bootcamp, students of the tripartite Master of Science in Global Hospitality Business (MGH) programme received the designation of Certified Hotel Valuation Software Consultant (CHVSC).\nStudents in the MGH 6.0 cohort completed the SHTM-HVS Bootcamp by taking an intensive online course, \"How to Perform a Hotel Market Analysis, Make Financial Projections and Value a Hotel Using Hotel Market Analysis and Valuation Software\", delivered by Mr Steve Rushmore, a course developer and instructor. Mr Rushmore is also the Chairman of the SHTM Advisory Committee.\nThe designation was hard-earned, but the students' efforts have paid off. Let's hear from some of them.\n\"I have just been granted the Certified Hotel Valuation Software Consultant (CHVSC) designation. During the course taught by Mr Steve Rushmore of HVS, I learned how to analyse information and data from the hotel market and process it into estimates of occupancies and average room rates. I also learned how to project revenues and expenses and apply a mortgage-equity valuation model before finally developing a reasonable estimate value for the subject property. The course was challenging, and by persevering, I overcame the challenges presented by these tasks, which ultimately enriched my skillset in hotel valuation.\" \nPierandrea Falchi ǀ Italy\n\"I recently received the Certified Hotel Valuation Software Consultant (CHVSC) designation. Thank you to Mr Steve Rushmore for developing and communicating this software to the MGH programme. I can now analyse data from the hotel market, forecast average room rates, project revenues and expenses and apply data to a mortgage-equity valuation model. I developed a reasonable estimated value for a subject property based on a case study. This has been an informative course that has taught me valuable lessons I can bring with me to my future career.\" \nKatarina Opheim Olsvik ǀ Norway\n\"I am happy to share that I have just been granted the Certified Hotel Valuation Software Consultant (CHVSC) designation. Thank you to Mr Steve Rushmore for developing this course. I had the opportunity to gain insight into the Hotel Real Estate Valuation throughout the course. I definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in hotel valuation. This course has prepared me for the industry by laying a steady foundation.\" \nSalvatore Francesco Palumbo ǀ Italy\n\"Recently, I was granted the Certified Hotel Valuation Software Consultant (CHVSC) designation. Thank you, Mr Steve Rushmore, for providing me with a thorough understanding of hotel valuation. While on the course, I learned how to analyse a hotel's market data. I could also make projections of revenue and expense based on the data of a similar hotel. Eventually, I was able to apply the data to a mortgage-equity valuation model and propose an estimated market value for the subject property. I definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in hotel valuation. This course has laid a steady foundation to prepare me for work in the industry.\" \nCharlene Ren ǀ Mainland China\nOffered by the SHTM in Hong Kong, the Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne in Switzerland and the Conrad N.
