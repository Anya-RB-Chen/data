  "text": "Dr Jeongyeon Lee, Research Assistant Professor, recently published a highly impactful article entitled “Multifunctional Polymeric Phthalocyanine-Coated Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Redox Mediators of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries” in Advanced Energy Materials (IF: 29.698), with Prof. Ho Seok Park and his team at Sungkyunkwan University. \nDr Lee and his team members reported the synthesis of uniform triethylene glycol (TEG) functionalised polymeric cobalt phthalocyanines (CoPcs) coated onto the surface of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MCs) by using CoPc–MC conjugates. They discussed in detail the formation mechanism of such nanocomposites and explained how their structure is correlated to enhanced transport kinetics, high S loading, and long-term cycling stability when applied as S hosts in Li-S batteries. The novel S hosts offer five distinct characteristics for Li-S batteries: \nThe Co ions in the centre of the Pc functions as a redox mediator for LiPS conversion, which improves the reaction kinetics during cycling. \nElemental N atoms around the Co ions efficiently donate electrons and create polar contacts with the Li atoms of LiPSs to prevent excessive LiPS dissolution. \nBy acting as lithiophilic sites that can accommodate Li ions, the oxygen (O) atoms in the TEG linkers mimic the O atoms in 12-crown-4 (a crown ether) and reduce gradients in Li-ion concentration. \nThe aromatic rings of the electrons of the Pc increase the electron transport in MCs. \nThe TCP coating can inhibit the aggregation of Pcs on MCs, thus producing well-dispersed active metal sites. \nDr Lee has extensively published various research articles in the most recent three years related to energy storage and conversion applications in the following journals: Advanced Energy Materials, Infomat, EnergyChem, Small, Small Methods, and Chemical Engineering Journal, and 8 other papers in SCIE journals. \nReferences: \nKim, Y., Kim, W.

  "text": "One of the most anticipated events every year is the summer internship programme at SFT, which provides talented students with the valuable opportunity to jumpstart their career. Since 2018, the programme has offered unique opportunities for students to work on real projects alongside industry professionals, which provide them with valuable hands-on experience and the ability to apply classroom knowledge to real-life situations while building their professional networks. The students are also a source of high-calibre interns for the fashion industry who cultivates them into valuable assets for our industrial partners. \nThe economy and prospects of Hong Kong have improved visibly in the first half of 2023, which have subsequently led to the improvement of the labour market. SFT students also benefit because there are more summer internship opportunities. This year, 34 local and international reputable companies are offering 97 openings, which attracted hundreds of applications from our undergraduate students. Among these companies, SFT is excited to welcome new partners including Hermès, Fashion Clinic, Agnes b, J Crew, Rag & Co, and Swire Resources Ltd. \nTo assist students in preparation for a successful application and productive internship, SFT has specially invited HR senior executives of Loro Piana and The Children's Place to host training workshops. \nTo further expand the programme, SFT launched the Summer Internship Partnership Scheme which allows our partners to employ more student interns or extend the duration of the internship with the same budget, thus offering more flexibility and options. Our aim is to strengthen partnerships with the fashion industry and provide the best possible opportunities to our students to enhance their competence through this win-win situation for both our students and partners.",

  "text": "Two young SFT researchers, Dr Fan Di and Dr Huang Qiyao, have been recognised by the Young Scientists Fund 2022 of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) for their research projects. The funding has been made available to Hong Kong researchers and universities for the first time ever. Each project is granted RMB 300,000 to support basic research work for three years.\nDr Fan Di - Corporate Carbon Neutrality Goal Settings in Chinese Industrial Sectors: Antecedents and Consequences \nClimate change is a huge challenge, and countries are working to reduce carbon emissions. Companies play a significant role in the process, but many Chinese businesses have yet to set their own carbon goals. Their lack of participation can make it difficult for China to achieve its 2060 carbon neutrality target. In response, Dr Fan Di, Assistant Professor of SFT and member of the Research Centre for Resources Engineering towards Carbon Neutrality (RCRE) and his research team explore why Chinese companies set carbon goals (or not) and what happens when they do. The research team believes that companies are more likely to set carbon goals if they have confident leaders, are close to their targets, and feel the need to protect the environment. They also think that setting goals helps companies to reduce emissions and boost profits. \nThe team will study different Chinese companies and use experiments to test their ideas. The findings can help researchers, companies, and governments make better decisions about managing the environment and running businesses in a sustainable way.\nThe research will show how setting environmental goals affects company success. Even if some companies are struggling, the team believes that setting carbon goals can help them prosper in the long-run. Policymakers can use the findings to support businesses in becoming greener, helping China to achieve its carbon reduction targets and improving life for everyone.\nDr Huang Qiyao - Study on the structures and performance of energy storage textiles enabled by tailored fiber placement \nWith the rapid development of smart electronic textiles that are lightweight, multifunctional, and can be integrated into various structures, the corresponding power systems needs to have high energy performance, excellent flexibility, and wearability. Developing fibre-based energy storage devices for direct integration into textile electronic devices is a promising strategy to achieve the wear comfort and durability of wearable electronics. However, current fibre-based energy storage devices are vulnerable during the fabrication and integration processes which leads to performance degradation and even failure. \nDr Huang Qiyao, Assistant Professor of SFT and member of the Research Institute for Intelligent Wearable Systems (RI-IWEAR), aims to develop a universal approach to achieve the flexible fabrication and integration of fibrous electrodes into flexible battery textiles. In this project, high-performance flexible electrode fibres will be developed, and then integrated into battery textiles via a simple embroidery technology[WL1]. Through the rational designs of materials and structures, optimisation of device configurations, and a study on the failure mechanism of such batteries upon fabrication and mechanical deformation, the stability of the structure and electrochemical performance of battery textiles shall be greatly improved. More importantly, new types of flexible battery textiles with customisable configurations will be fabricated. The success of this project will provide new scientific insights into the study of energy storage textiles, and new knowledge for the fabrication and integration of fibre-based batteries in applications of smart electronic textiles and wearable electronics. \nProf. Christina Wong, Director of Research and Innovation at PolyU, said, “We are thankful for the support from the NSFC Young Scientists Fund for Hong Kong researchers, which will facilitate and strengthen our research projects and the professional development of our scientists. PolyU has exceptional scholars and experts who are committed to interdisciplinary research work that have real impacts on the technological, social and economic development of Hong Kong and China.\"",

  "text": "Five impactful innovations from SFT garnered one Gold Medals with Congratulations of the Jury and four Gold Medals at the 48th International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva (Geneva Inventions Expo), widely regarded as among the most important annual global events devoted exclusively to inventions. This year, about 1,000 inventions from about 40 countries and regions were attracted.\nThese award-winning innovations improve people’s lives and expand humankind’s horizons. In addition, these innovations help the world adapt prepare for future pandemics, as well as safeguard people’s health and well-being.\nGold Medal with Congratulations of the Jury: AI-Assisted Design of Functional Clothing for Scoliosis Treatment\nPrincipal investigator: Dr Joanne Yip, Associate Dean and Associate Professor\nThis new approach significantly improves scoliosis treatment and the quality of life for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients by adopting AI to create tailor-made functional clothing for treating AIS. Patient data is used to train a decision tree and three neural networks to prescribe and configure the brace, which is then customised by professionals. Optimised designs, e.g., padding placement, tightness of elastic straps and configurable 3D structures, are suggested to enhance functionality, increase wearing comfort, and reduce the wearer’s spinal curvature. This makes an excellent alternative to the heavy and uncomfortable traditional braces prescribed by orthotists.\nGold Medal: A Sport-Specific Soft Manikin System for Sports Bra Design \nPrincipal investigator: Dr Yick Kit-lun, Associate Professor\nThis soft manikin system offers a complete solution and scientific guidelines for designing effective sports bras, providing designers with valuable insights. Using simulated skin, breast tissue and human running motion, it can replace human bra fit trials and measures the performance and pressure of sports bras scientifically, objectively and reliably. The biomechanics of breast motion are incorporated to evaluate and optimise the fit, comfort, support, and protection offered by sports bras. It measures bra pressure and sensation comfort, while tracking 3D body and breast motion to assess the bras’ breast control performance in all directions (X, Y and Z). \nGold Medal: Revolutionary Mussel-inspired Polyester for Next Generation Sportswear and Functional Clothing \nPrincipal investigator: Prof. John Xin, Lee Family Professor in Fashion & Textiles, Chair Professor of Textile Chemistry\nInspired by how marine mussels stick to rocks, this invention improves polyester’s abilities to absorb water, resist odours and prevent static electricity build-up by adding a special polymer which forms a long-lasting bond with the polyester. When sprayed on one side of the polyester, it creates a one-way moisture transport effect, meaning that sweat and water is absorbed by the clothing and transported from the body, keeping the wearer cool and dry. The resulting clothes are more comfortable and hygienic to wear, and can withstand over 100 laundry cycles. This technology is ideal for making sportswear and other functional clothing.\nGold Medal: Safe and Eco-friendly Antimicrobial Materials with High Efficiency \nPrincipal investigators: Prof. Tao Xiaoming, Director, Research Centre of Smart Wearable Technology, Vincent and Lily Woo Endowed Professorship in Textiles Technology, Chair Professor of Textile Technology and Dr Zhang Ziheng, Postdoctoral Fellow; CEO, Ecolar Technology Limited (a PolyU Academic-led start-up)\nNovel proprietary technologies have been developed to prepare highly-efficient, eco-friendly antimicrobial polyhydroxyalkanoate oligomers (PHAOs), which can be used as disinfectants, finishing agents for personal protective equipment, and in PHAO/PA blend yarns. These PHAO materials are ideal for medical applications as they are fully biodegradable, transparent, non-toxic and non-allergic. With wide-spectrum antimicrobial properties, they can eliminate more than 99.99% of S. Aureus, K. pneumoniae, C. albicans, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, as well as COVID-19, H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Compared with current commercial antimicrobial agents, they are more effective against microbes, safer, more biodegradable, cheaper, and emit less carbon.\nGold Medal: Long-lasting Self-disinfecting Materials Technology \nPrincipal investigators: Dr Chris Lo, Associate Professor, Co-Founder, Immune Materials Limited (a PolyU Academic-led startup) and Prof. Kan Chi-wai, Professor, Co-Founder, Immune Materials Limited \nThe world's first antiviral 3D printing technology developed by Immune Materials Limited is used to create products that can eliminate 70% and 99.2% of the pathogens on their surface within two minutes and 20 minutes respectively. It is highly effective in preventing the spread of pathogens, e.g. E. coli and human coronavirus, in settings such as healthcare facilities, schools, and public transportation. The resulting products have a long-lasting performance of over three years, and can be custom-designed in any shapes and sizes. This technology can also be used to produce high-quality, soft, non-toxic and versatile materials, such as vegan leather.\nRelated news:\nHong Kong Economic Times | 【揚威海外】理大28項發明奪日內瓦發明展獎項 助治療脊柱側彎、減慢兒童近視加深\nOriental Daily News | 日內瓦發明展 理大破紀錄奪31獎\nMing Pao Daily News | 理大研功能衣矯脊柱側彎 「服裝設計不止靚唔靚」",

  "text": "Congratulations to the research student Nga-Yin Dik who is supervised by Dr Chris Lo, recently won the Best Paper Runner-up Award and received a cash prize of up to HK$20,000 at the PolyU Research Student Conference (PRSC) 2023. The conference was organised by the Graduate School (GS), and held on 8-9 May 2023 on campus.\nOf the 338 submissions, only 6 papers were selected for best paper. Michel's paper, titled “Developing a Prediction Model for Virtual Garment Fitting Size with Psychographic Characteristics and 3D Body Measurements”, proposes the use of a prediction model for virtual garment fitting based on an artificial neural network (ANN) to investigate the variations in the ease preferences of end users through their 3D body measurements and psychographic characteristics for wearing garments, and also a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to visualise wore avatars with fast and accurate results.\nAbout the PolyU Research Student Conference (PRSC 2023)\nAiming to promote innovative and high-quality research, the PRSC is a flagship research student conference that provides research postgraduate (RPg) students and the students of the College of Undergraduate Researchers and Innovators (CURI) at PolyU with the opportunity to present their research work and findings. The PRSC also provides an excellent opportunity for students from different disciplines to network with their peers, and establishes a collaborative and active research community at PolyU. The theme of the PRSC is “Research with Impact”. The organising committee is now inviting submissions that describe original research. RPg students of all disciplines at all stages of study and CURI students are welcome to submit papers on any topic.",

  "text": "Components of Academic Advising Academic Advising System \nConveying the purposes of PolyU - includes advice and consultation with regards to the aims of higher education, the reasons for the academic requirements, expected standards of achievement, etc.\nInformation giving - includes advice and consultation about registration, course offerings, areas of staff interest and expertise, educational opportunities, degree programmes and requirements, educational policies and regulations, as well as administrative procedures.\nShort-range programme planning - includes advice and consultation on scheduling sequences and course planning, registration and schedule adjustments, etc.\nLong-range planning - includes advice and consultation about educational and professional objectives consistent with the student’s demonstrated academic abilities and interests, as well as identification of the relationship between courses, programmes, majors, and occupations.\nStudent referral - since advisors cannot possibly meet the needs of all students, specialized campus services at the Student Affairs Office and Office of Undergraduate Studies are available for advice and consultation that are complementary to the knowledge and skills of the advisors.\nFacilitating student development - includes interest in the student’s goals and problems, establishment of rapport, development of the student’s self-awareness, etc.\nIt is believed that the current academic advising system provides students with the opportunity to plan, discuss, and review academic progress, as well as enhances student satisfaction with their academic experience, better self-understanding and a sense of success in the achievement of personal and academic goals. To achieve these aspects, the terms of the academic advising system is outlined below.\nThe First Year - The first year is generally a time of exploration for students. The undergraduate degree structure at SFT is offered as a scheme in Fashion and Textiles, which comprises 5 specialisms in the areas of technology, business and design. In taking a current and flexible admission approach, students who are being admitted to the new 4-year curriculum do not have to decide on a study specialism in advance. They can map out an individual study path that suits their interests, abilities and learning needs so as to enable them to realize their academic aspirations and develop to their full potential. During the first year of study, a series of broad discipline subjects are offered to all students to build comprehensive basic knowledge in the fibre based industry. Students are encouraged to engage in various co-curricular activities so as to widen their horizons, particularly with regard to acquiring a global perspective. \nIn considering the diversified learning backgrounds of school leavers (due to a wide choice of core and elective subjects and applied learning courses) under the new secondary school curriculum and the flexible approach of admitting students to the new 4-year curriculum, all first-year undergraduate students will be assigned to an Academic Advisor. Each student will have a single Academic Advisor throughout his/her entire study at SFT to strengthen his/her connection to the Department and the University. Students are required to meet with his/her Academic Advisor once every semester to discuss different academic issues. Academic Advisors can use one or more of a variety of delivery options, e.g. face-to-face, small groups, email, telephone, Blackboard, social media, etc. so as to maintain a suitable connection with students. Suitable records of the student’s progress upon each meeting should be kept, including the academic planning profile, academic results, schedule of classes, etc. Students can also contact SFT General Office and/or seek advice from the Undergraduate Secretary on academic rules and regulations of the University, programme requirements, definitive programme scheme, up-to-date academic advising information, etc. \nMoreover, the 4-year curriculum offers a mandatory 3-credit Freshman Seminar for students who are studying in the Scheme of Fashion and Textiles. To encourage student engagement with the Department and the University, the subject offers an array of learning enrichment activities for first-year SFT students that will familiarise them with the workshops, studios, facilities and academic culture at SFT, as well as the support services of the University. It also provides an accurate prospect of different majors under the Scheme of Fashion and Textiles, as well as the importance and relevance of fundamental knowledge in textile technology for career development in the industry so as to ensure student success under the new degree curriculum.\nThe Second Year - Under the new 4-year curriculum, the streaming into different specialisms will take place during the second semester of Year 2. Students often face the challenge of deciding their specialisms according to their particular intellectual and post-graduate goals. In this period, students may continue to consult with their Academic Advisors or other academic staff from their first year of study. In addition, they can also discuss with Discipline Leaders who are the coordinators of the 5 majors in the Scheme. The Discipline Leaders can provide a full perspective that a student requires for specialism selection. \nApart from academic planning, students are encouraged to engage in various co-curricular activities so as to widen their horizons, particularly with regard to acquiring a global perspective. Students can seek advice about student exchange programmes and possible internships from different sources, such as the Departmental Student Exchange Officer and Career Officer. Hence, they can develop their own self-development plan and/or short-range programme planning based on their own interests. Nevertheless, students are encouraged to take the responsibility and initiative for their own academic direction. During the advising process, students must assume the primary responsibility for final decisions on subject scheduling and programme planning, particularly when these are inconsistent with the requirements of the chosen specialisms.\nThe Third Year - Once a student identifies a specialism, his/her academic direction becomes clearer and more focused. In the third year, students are asked to select elective subjects and prepare for the Final Year Project. Some students may even enrol in a minor programme so as to explore alternative avenues of interest and career paths. At this stage, the Academic Advisor and Discipline Leader will serve as the sources of direction and help students to make connections with staff members who have relevant experience and can give guidance, and/or specialized campus services.\nThe Fourth Year - At this juncture, students are working to complete their specialism study, the General University Requirements, and Final Year Project. Also, most students are thinking about what to do after graduation. At this stage, the Academic Advisor, Career Officer and Discipline Leader will serve as the sources for direction, perhaps advising a student for postgraduate studies or directing students about graduate work in their own field. Students can therefore prepare a long-range self-development plan to facilitate their choice of career and/or pursue further study.",

The programme is offered not only to SFT students but PolyU students from all disciplines. To join the institutional exchange, students need to personally research on which department(s) and which academic programme(s) for their proposed exchange study, they also need to consider what courses to study overseas are credit transferrable.\nInstitutional exchange programmes are administered by the Global Engagement Office.\nThe exchange period is as follows:\nSemester 1 | Fall Exchange\nSemester 2 | Spring Exchange\nSemester 3 | Summer Exchange (not applicable for exchange programmes in Mainland China and Taiwan)\nSFT has been ogranising departmental exchange since the spring of 2003. Over the years, SFT has partnered with nearly 30 leading fashion and textile schools around the world offering our students with different learning experience through exchange study.",

  "text": "Student exchange programme is a credit bearing programme that offers students maximum flexibility in their undergraduate studies. Students can choose to study with one of the partner institutions overseas for one semester. Most importantly, the credits earned overseas are transferrable to their current programme at PolyU. The exchange does not require extra tuition fee but students would need to continue to pay for the PolyU tuition fee.\nReasons for exchange \nThe international exchange program is an opportunity for students to experience studying abroad, outside of their habitual cultural context. Exchanging abroad can be a life-changing experience, students may:\ndevelop the life skills you need for adapting to the rapid pace of change in the global environment;\nacquire the skills for studying and living in a different culture;\nimprove your language skills by immersing yourself in a foreign language environment;\ndevelop friendships across different cultures;\nbecome more independent and mature;\nunderstand more about your own values, practices and beliefs through reacting to another culture;\nextend your personal competitiveness for future career development.\nAt SFT, all full-time undergraduate students are eligible to apply. Students can choose to have international exchange experience by joining either institutional exchange or departmental exchange programme.\nGood academic standing (GPA 3.0 or above for non‐Design students, GPA 2.8 or above for design students);\nWell written study plan and financial plan;\nActive participation in extra‐curricular activities (e.g. International Club and ITC Buddy);\nInterview performance (language proficiency, communication skill, attitude and characters, overall assessment).\nStudent exchange could be life-changing experience and it is also a challenging 'project' for every participant. Along the journey, you will learn how to solve all kinds of problem. The professional team of international exchange programme would of course walk side-by-side with you.\nPRE-DEPARTURE ARRANGEMENTS\nACADEMIC ARRANGEMENTS\tNON-ACADEMIC ARRANGEMENTS\t\nSubject selection (please refer to Credit Transfer section below)\nFYP preparation\nApplying for student visa\nBooking air tickets\nPurchasing Insurance\nAttending IAO briefing\nBooking accommodation\nPreparing clothes, books, course materials, money\nSponsorship application\nStage One\nIdentify an exchange destination that fits your study plan from the available partners of that semester shown on the Call for Applications.\nCheck country/university/course/subject details.\nFill in and return the SFTSE-01 application form and online application form to SFT General Office by the given deadline with supporting documents (if any).\nShortlisted students will be invited for a selection interview.\nInterview results would be announced in about two weeks time after the interview.\nStage Two\nAn outbound briefing session will be arranged. Application details of the host institutions will be explained and given in the briefing session. Previous year's exchanged students may be invited to share their overseas experience.\nSuccessful applicants will be nominated by School for student exchange programme. Students should submit application to the host institutions via Global Engagement Office (GEO) or Department.\nStudents should also seek subject selection approval from specialism coordinators for credit transfer.\nStage Three\nStudents are suggested to follow up their applications with the host institutions directly. Confirmation letters are normally received about 3-5 weeks after submission of application.\nUpon receiving the confirmation letter, students could apply for the Student Exchange Sponsorship and/or Hardship Fund for Overseas Exchange Programme via GEO.\nSemester 1 Exchange (Autumn/Fall Semester)\nCall for application:\n\tDec - Jan\nApplication deadline:\tJan\nInterview schedule\tJan\t\nResults announcement:\tFeb\t\nExchange period:\tSept - Dec\t\nSemester 2 Exchange (Spring Semester) \nApplication period:\tMay - Aug \t\nApplication deadline:\tAug\t\nInterview schedule:\tAug\t\nResults announcement:\tSept\t\nExchange period:\tJan - Jun\t\nRemarks: Detailed schedule of each year should refer to the call for application\nApplication for Prior Agreement for Subject Selection at Exchange-out Institution\nPlease complete the form and return to SFT General Office. \nWith reference to PolyU's Academic Regulations and Procedures, credit transfer can be applicable to credits earned by students through study at an overseas institution and under an approved exchange programme. Students should, before they go abroad for the exchange programme, seek prior approval from the School on their study plan and credit transferability. The procedures are shown below:\nBefore Departure \nSuccessful applicants (short-listed candidates nominated by school) should check the course and subject details with the host institutions. Students can consult the Discipline Leaders for subject selection.\nApply for subject approval after getting the official offer letter from the host university.\nStudents should download the form \"Application for Prior Agreement for Subject Selection at Exchange-out Institution\" (Form AR41a) from the homepage of Academic Registry.\nStudents must seek approval on credit transferability of the subjects selected with Discipline Leaders to complete the form. Discipline Leaders would determine the credit transferability based on academic equivalence with the corresponding subjects on offer at PolyU, and the comparability of the grading systems adopted by PolyU and the overseas institution. Credits thus approved for transfer will count towards the PolyU award requirement. In order to overcome the problems associated with subject-to-subject mappings and the preparation of student transcripts, this can be done on the basis of a block credit transfer rather than on a subject-by-subject basis.\nIn general, the total number of credits (for textile and fashion related subjects) to be taken at the host institution should not be less than the required core subject credits (or equivalent credit hours a week) as at SFT in one semester. Students must pass the approved subjects for credit transfer. \nThe original approved form AR41a (you must keep a photocopy / e-copy with you) with a copy of offer letter, brief course info and supporting documents (if any) must be submitted to the General Office (QT715) at least 2 weeks before they go abroad for the exchange programme.\nUpon Arrival of Host Institution \nStudents should keep Discipline Leaders and Student Exchange Officers informed for any changes of subject at host institutions.\nIf any change of subject is needed at host institutions, students should contact Discipline Leaders by email seeking approval for the change. It should be indicated clearly in the email application the reason and detail of the changes (changing from which subject(s) to which new subject(s)). Student must provide subject information or syllabus of the new subject(s) when they submit the email application. \nStudents cannot seek approval on subject change after return to HK.\nUpon returning Hong Kong, students should submit credit transfer applications by the given deadline, to Student Exchange Officer in person with the following documents: \nOfficial academic transcripts issued by the host university (both original and a photocopy);\nSubject syllabi/ course description;\nThe approved form \"Application for Prior Agreement for Subject Selection at Exchange-out Institution\" (Form AR41a); and\nEmail approval for change of subjects from Discipline Leaders if the subjects enrolled are different from what originally approved in theAR41a form. \nFor students failed in any of the attended subjects during exchange, Discipline Leaders would determine the credit transferability and recommend the corresponding subject(s) offered at the PolyU to replace the failed subject(s) at their final year of study. If students are unable to take the required minimum number of credits (core subject credits of that semester) or equivalent, they have to re-take some subjects in order to fulfill the requirement stated on the programme scheme.\nExchange report will also be assessed for credit transfer.\nAs an exchange student, you do not need to pay addition tuition to your host institution as it is a reciprocal arrangement. However, you are required to continue paying your tuition at PolyU.\nWhen you do you financial budget for your exchange, please bear in mind you need to include the following, but not limited, to your budget.\nRoundtrip flight ticket\nAccommodation\nVisa application fee\nInsurance\nDaily expenses (meals, laundry, etc.)\nBooks and stationeries\nOn average, the expenses would be around HK$65,000 to HK$90,000 (US/European exchange partners) or HK$20,000 to HK$40,000 (China/Asian partners) for one semester. Students choose fashion cities like London, New York, and Amsterdam would expect higher expenses (about HK$70,000 ~ HK$90,000) because of the high living cost there. \nFrom time to time, industrialists donate scholarships to encourage and support our students for joining overseas exchange. Some industrial donated scholarships include:\nVincent V.C. Woo Exchange Scholarship: 2 students x HK$58,000 each (the scholarship is based on academic merit and financial needs, and preference will be given to students who have exchange study at Cornell University.)\nVincent and Lily Woo Exchange Scholarship: HK$10,000 ~ HK$30,000 each x 3 ~ 4 students\nCrystal Group Overseas Exchange Scholarship: Maximum 5 students X HK$40,000 each. Preferences will be given to students from (1) Fashion and Textile Design, (2) Knitwear Design and Technology, (3) Intimate Apparel or (4) Fashion Technology specialisms who will study technical and functional textiles or related courses at the host universities. As a condition of the award, each awardee must complete a paid summer internship at the Donor’s Company in Chinese mainland in the year of award.\nFang Brothers Knitting Ltd Exchange Scholarship: HK$10,000 ~ HK$30,000 each x 6~10 students.\nFung Scholarship: 1 student, about HK$10,000 ~ HK$40,000 each\nCheng Yik Hung Overseas Exchange Scholarship: 3 students X USD 5000 each (Preference will be given to students who have exchange study at The Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), New York.\nKayser and Eleanor Sung Memorial Fund Student Exchange Scholarship: HK$ 30,000 each X 1 student. Preference will be given to students studying (1) Fashion and Textile Technology or (2) Knitwear Design and Technology specialisms.\nScholarship Application\nWhen students submit applications for the student exchange programme, the same application documents will be used to assess scholarship application as well. No separate scholarship application is needed. Students will be selected and nominated by the department based on different scholarship criteria.\nPolyU will provide sponsorship to each outbound exchange student. The sponsorship is meant to cover part of the expenses incurred by the exchange such as passage, accommodation and other incidental expenses. The amount of Sponsorship for each student will vary according to destination, e.g. HK$19,000 for one semester exchange to US, Canada, Europe, etc.\nStudents can also apply for the hardship fund via GEO if there is financial need. The Finance Office will arrange auto‐pay of the sponsorship to students' bank accounts before their departures. Students are required to submit a report (including a summary on the expenses incurred by the exchange) upon completion of the exchange.\nUseful Links\nUseful Links",

  "text": "All normal year students start the programme with two common semesters, which provide a foundation in the major activities of the fashion and textiles industries. After these common semesters, students are streamed into one of the five specialisms according to the students’ individual preferences. In principle, all students are offered a free choice of specialism. However, in the unlikely event that a specialism is over-subscribed, a contingency procedure is followed. As each specialism has a threshold number of students, determined by the teaching resources of the School, the contingency procedure is applied when this threshold is reached. Therefore, students are required to supply a list of specialisms in order of preference. Specialism selection normally occurs in the second semester of the students’ first year of study. Students will be invited for a selection interview / assessment based on their choice of specialisms. The pool of students in the over-subscribed specialism will be ranked according to academic performance in their first semester of study and interview / assessment performance. Students with lower rankings will have a lower priority in admittance to their preferred specialism.

Its rich historical and cultural heritage provides many opportunities and possibilities. As I step into my third year of study as a student in the BA Fashion and Textiles programme, I recognise that I have already built up practical design skills and widened my horizons by participating in industry events. PolyU has given me a forum for meeting professionals and accumulating experiences. It has also provided me with a large variety of scholarship opportunities, which support my academic study and my career development. At PolyU, I am learning how to transform brainstorms into actual ideas and to develop appropriate visual elements. I am grateful to have had an internship opportunity at Store by PolyU Fashion and for the invitation to participate in CENTRESTAGE. The internship has given me a chance to explore social media promotion strategies and strengthen my skills in visual editing. With the help of professors from SFT and industry professionals, I am confident that I can build my own brand and receive positive feedback from the market. Through CENTRESTAGE, I have built industry connections and a deeper understanding of how to run a business. PolyU has provided me with various opportunities that are helping me make my dream come true.\nJIM Yu-ching Natalie\nBA (HONS) FASHION & TEXTILES (DESIGN)\nMy time at PolyU as an undergraduate student at SFT has been invaluable and incomparable. It not only gave me academic opportunities, but also access to the multitude of industry networks that PolyU is a part of. Academically, the flexibility was exceptional, giving students the opportunity to explore all facets of the fashion world, from design to technology to business, and this helped me better plan my future career. Externally, I got to be a part of many memorable and incredible experiences, thanks to PolyU’s and SFT’s support. For example, one of my favourite experiences was an internship at HK’s leading luxury retailer, Lane Crawford. At this internship, I applied my university knowledge, contributing ideas while also gaining insight into how to buy the right products and communicate with suppliers. Moreover, I was selected to represent PolyU at the prestigious World Retail Challenge, where I gained new perspectives on sustainability in fashion and how brands can tackle this from a global array of like-minded students and teachers. All these opportunities have shaped my passions and built my confidence. SFT can open new doors for you too!\nSHAH Muskan Sunish\nBA (HONS) FASHION & TEXTILES (RETAIL & MARKETING)\nThe School has offered me so many opportunities, from participation in cross-departmental functions to collaborations with overseas counterparts. There is still so much that I have not experienced, and I am excited to learn more. During a recent market analysis, I was able to apply the knowledge and skills that I acquired at ITC (now renamed SFT). I am pleased that my supervisors appreciated my hard work and seriously considered my suggestions for future planning. I am thankful that I chose this programme as the beginning for my journey in the fashion industry.\nNG Yuet Tung Lydia\nGraduate in BA (HONS) FASHION & TEXTILES (RETAIL & MARKETING)",

  "text": "The fashion art exhibition Alterity: The State of Being a Woman is my creative response to the question Simone de Beauvoir asked about a century ago: “What is a woman?”\nThe body of work here is my contribution toward reimagining what it means to be a woman based on the multitude of concepts “woman” embodies and metaphors she symbolizes throughout history. This exhibition consists of ten artworks that visually represent the kaleidoscopic symbolization of a woman, her body, and feminine sexuality— some ambivalent (e.g., life/birth vs. death, salvation vs. damnation, earth vs. sea, desire vs. control) and some paradoxical (i.e., a woman is a regenerator but not a creator), physical and psychological entrapments, and empowerment. These designs build on an underlying principle that has guided my creative work throughout my career, creating harmony by juxtaposing different concepts and elements of different times or different places, and by exploring innovative shapes, textures, and silhouettes.\nI envision that my work presents the audience with a visual story of how women were defined as the Other and how they have overcome through endurance and struggle, leaving viewers to ask themselves if they have been part of the Othering or part of the empowerment.",

All are year-3 students studying BSc (Hons) in Digital Fashion. They showcased their creative designs and impressed the audience and judges by their strives for sustainable fashion in the competition held at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on 22 Feb 2023.\nThe Competition, organized by Hong Kong Fur Federation, has a strong focus on sustainability of upcycling, recycling, reusing and transforming vintage and waste fur into a biodegradable, relevant and contemporary new design. The Federation has been hosting the competition since 1987. The event aims at promoting the originality of fur fashion by kindling the interest of local design students in an attempt to recruit young talented designers for the industry. \nThe 4 students joined the competition as a programme-and-industry collaborative project and were shortlisted, out of a few hundred of contestants, as top 10 finalists for the final show and competition. Moon Lau with her design entitled “The Great Wave” won the overall champion in the competition that night, receiving a cash prize of HK$30000 plus other rewards including a study trip to Finland.\nAbout the Hong Kong Fur Federation (HKFF) \nFFF was established in 1979 to coordinate fur trade activities and promote its development. Today it is a thriving organization with over 150 members, representing the vast majority of the industry in Hong Kong. With the exception of fur farming, the Federation comprises members from all sectors of the industry, from raw material distribution and processing (skin dealers and skin dressers) to manufacturing and marketing. Every year the Hong Kong Fur Federation organizes a programme of activities in Hong Kong and overseas to promote the fur industry. Empowered by its own ingenious flexibility and creativity, as well as with the full support of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council in various events, the Hong Kong fur industry has bloomed with flying colors. In the years to come, the Hong Kong Fur Federation will strive to uphold the statue of Hong Kong as the world's premier fur manufacturing hub and exporter through a comprehensive array of promotions and marketing activities.",

For example, one of my favourite experiences was an internship at HK’s leading luxury retailer, Lane Crawford. At this internship, I applied my university knowledge, contributing ideas while also gaining insight into how to buy the right products and communicate with suppliers.

  "text": "All students start the programme with three common semesters, which provide foundational knowledge of the major activities of the fashion and textiles industry. After the common semesters, each student is streamed to one of five specialisms according to their individual preference.\nFor the design-related specialisms, i.e. Design, and Knitwear Design and Technology, students have to pass a design-related interview after completing their first year of study.\nIn principle, all students are offered a free choice of specialism. However, a contingency procedure is followed in the unlikely event that a particular specialism is over-subscribed. Each specialism has a threshold number of students determined by the teaching resources of the Department, and the contingency procedure is applied when this threshold is reached. In this case, students are required to declare a selection list of specialisms in order of preference. The pool of students in the over-subscribed specialism are ranked according to their academic performance during the last three semesters. Students with less satisfactory performance are required to join their second choice specialism.\nIn the semesters after admission to the respective specialism, compulsory subjects pertaining to each specialism are offered together with a wide range of elective subjects to enrich students’ learning experience. Furthermore, students take mandatory language subjects, General University Requirement (GUR) subjects and Work-Integrated Education (WIE) to fulfil their graduation requirements.",

  "text": "Dr Dahua Shou and colleagues advance liquid engineering and publish in impactful journals\nDr Dahua Shou and his colleagues recently published a research article entitled “An All-Fabric Droplet-Based Energy Harvester with Topology Optimization” on intelligent wearables in the Advanced Energy Materials (IF: 29.368) journal, and a review paper entitled “Heterogeneously engineered porous materials and structures for directional and asymmetric liquid transport” on tunable liquid transport in Cell Reports Physical Science (a premium journal published by Cell Press which publishes cutting-edge research across the physical sciences, including chemistry, physics, materials science, energy science, engineering, and related interdisciplinary work).\nDr Shou’s team has developed a novel all-fabric, droplet-based electricity generator. The topology-optimised droplet energy harvesting fabric (TO-DEHF) enables stable and efficient output from randomly falling droplets. TO-DEHF has high flexibility and breathability, based on which a self-powered wireless wearable prototype has been successfully realised for monitoring crucial droplet properties, including temperature, pH and salinity. It has recently been reported that the output power density of a triboelectric nanogenerator can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude by using a field-effect-transistor-like structure. However, previously reported strip top electrodes are not ideal for optimum generation and stable transfer of charges under practical dynamic conditions. Switched on by an impinged droplet, the bridged closed-loop electric circuit transfers the accumulated charges by converting the conventional interfacial effect into a bulk effect. Randomly falling droplets cannot always exactly impinge the electrode with the desired spreading contact to achieve a high peak voltage, and a large fraction of low-voltage direct-contact and sliding-contact modes will lead to low output and instability. To address this critical challenge, the proposed TO-DEHF with the optimised fabric electrodes in a hexagonal network feature a stable open-circuit voltage under moving and rotating patterns, 3-fold that with strip electrodes. The peak power density of the TO-DEHF (71.8 mW/m2) is 4.8-fold that of the latter (14.8 mW/m2).\nIn the meantime, Dr Shou has comprehensively reviewed the latest progresses in advanced textiles for controllable liquid transport. Passive regulation of dynamic liquid transport in porous media in a directional or asymmetric manner has become increasingly critical to emerging applications such as personal moisture management, water harvesting, and liquid separation. Over the past decade, heterogeneously engineered porous materials and structures for tunable liquid transport have stimulated a remarkable amount of attention and triggered technological revolutions in those areas based on nature-inspired designs, metamaterial developments, and model-driven optimisation. Herein, Dr Shou and his colleagues provide an overview of the latest developments in directional and asymmetric liquid movements created by material and structural heterogeneities, with a focus on mechanistic models, physical mechanisms, and engineering strategies to provide a better understanding of controllability in directed liquid motion. The diverse implementations and applications with improved fluid directionality and asymmetry, from an overview of the fabrication methods to analyses of the significant influential factors, have been discussed. Current challenges and research gaps are summarised, in order to provide a road map for potential research opportunities.\nResearch studies of liquid engineering based on advanced textiles and intelligent wearables by Dr Shou and his colleagues have also been published in other impactful journals, including Advanced Functional Materials in 2018 (IF: 18.808); Science Advances (IF: 14.136) in 2020; and a series of prestigious mechanics journals including Physical Review E (2), Applied Physics Letters (1), Langmuir (3), and International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer (3) from 2011 to 2020. He has been awarded Vebleo Fellow and delivered a keynote talk entitled “Smart Textiles and Wearables for Thermal Comfort and Energy Saving\" for the Vebleo community.\nReferences:\n1.

The Exhibition is regarded as one of the most important annual global events devoted exclusively to inventions.\nThe awarded project of Dr Shou is entitled “Omni-Cool-DryTM: a Desert Beetle Inspired Skin-like Fabric for Dynamic Thermal and Moisture Management”. The team members include Prof. Jintu Fan, Head and Chair Professor of ITC, and a research student Mr Yuheng Gu.\nOmni-Cool-DryTM is a desert beetle inspired skin-like fabric, which promises all-day cool, dry, breathable, and comfortable feelings under dynamic thermal conditions. This unique fabric quickly dissipates excessive sweat as water droplets to avoid the sensation of wetness and saturation. It also reflects solar radiation and emits body heat to the cold universe for cooling. Compared to conventional fabrics, Omni-Cool-DryTM weighs 75% less, dissipates sweat 3 times faster, and is 50% less clingy during heavy perspiration. The human skin can be cooled by 5°C lower than with a piece of commercial cotton fabric. Omni-Cool-DryTM is treated to be water-repellent and coated with radiation cooling nanoparticles globally, while the local water channels are patterned with wettability gradient as “sweat glands”. The fabrication is scalable and cost-effective, compatible with the production process in the textile industry. This fabric will help outdoor enthusiasts and athletes to perform their best. It will also be desirable to professionals such as medical personnel, construction workers, and firefighters for more endurance.",

  "text": "Dr Dahua Shou receives support for “Development of Soft Robotic Clothing for Adaptive Thermal Management”\nDr Dahua Shou is the most recent recipient of research support from the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) via The Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles (HKRITA) for his project. It involves the development of soft robotic clothing for adaptive thermal management. The ITF which is administered by the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC), aims to increase the added value, productivity, and competitiveness in innovation and technology.\nPersonal thermal management is critical for the comfort and performance of human beings, especially for those who stay in varying thermal conditions. However, there are issues with wearing a conventional coat because the garment has a constant thermal resistance, which may fail to meet thermal requirements with changes in climate. For example, there is a large temperature difference between the different times of the day when the weather is changing from sunny to cloudy, or between morning and afternoon, or with indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore, thermoregulation of the body can be quite challenging. Moreover, excessive heat from highly active activities can often cause discomfort to wearers. For instance, the dramatically increased metabolic rate from resting to walking, which is 75 and 174 W/m2, respectively, will cause wearers to suffer from heat stress and heavy sweating even in the cold during the winter. The after-chill effect caused by wet clothing after sweating can be harmful and even fatal to human health.\nMaintaining a comfortable body temperature is one of the most basic human needs, but a substantial amount of energy is consumed to maintain a constant ambient temperature. Heating and cooling needs account for over 50% of building energy used, but the US Department of Energy projects a 9% -18% energy cost reduction when the thermostat is turned down 10 - 20°F. Therefore, thermal management clothing that maintains thermal comfort whilst adapting to an increased range of ambient temperature is highly desirable.\nDr Shou’s project intends to design and develop thermally adaptive clothing to maintain the body temperature of the wearer for comfort and performance under various thermal environments, by optimally regulating the clothing microclimate based on a novel soft robotic technology. Realising a thermal adaptive function within the same item of clothing is not only an exciting scientific challenge but also a significant technological advancement.",

  "text": "How might we unsettle approaches to design that have tended to prioritize the prosperity of corporations, and instead, design for social and climate justice? Articles of Displacement challenges some of the colonial and capitalist regimes that have fueled fashion’s role in producing the global climate crisis: industrialization of fiber production through large scale agriculture, corporate chemical engineering, synthetic dyeing and printing processes; designed and artificial obsolescence of fashion; and the exploitation of labor and environments in the mass-manufacture of clothing. By displacing some of these approaches to design, we empowered non-human actors, ecologies, and materials in a collaborative, relational, and responsive design process that centered longevity, multi-functionality, desire, delight, collectivism, and self-determination.\nArticles of Displacement was designed by Denise Nicole Green, a professor of Fashion Design at Cornell University, who collaborated with plants, people, places, and undergraduate studio assistant Nadine El Nesr to co-create a responsive collection. This meant that designs responded to factors, including: the availability of dyestuffs; the size, shape, and eventual coloration of each textile; anticipated environmental conditions and bodily movements; and commitment to material longevity. De-centering and displacing profit motivation and anthropocentrism enabled shared ecologies (i.e., the habitats, natural resources, and communities around us and part of us) to guide the design and production process.\nThe bio-based dyestuffs used in the collection come from food waste, invasive species, plant pests, local fauna, and plants grown in small gardens. The fabrics, however, are more complex and paradoxical. Most of the textiles in this collection are made from silk or nylon. Considered “twin polyamides,” these two fibers share similar chemistry, but have a dramatically different impact on the environment. Petroleum-based nylon was the first commercially successful thermoplastic polymer and shaped the landscape of industrial manufacturing in the mid-20th century. Blending nylon with spandex accelerated the growth of activewear apparel since the 1970s. Unlike silk, which is easily weakened by ultraviolet light, heat, and abrasion, nylon is one of the most durable fibers. By using one of the culprits of climate change, Articles of Displacement addresses the inescapability of industrial capitalism’s penumbra and the products innovated under these regimes. By rebuilding connections to plants and other raw materials required for dyeing, creating inter-reliant systems of production through co-design, and employing some of the products of the plight, Articles of Displacement imagines a future where design is a collective, material, embodied, inter-species, place-making, and community-creating endeavor.",

  "text": "This is an era of rapidly evolving technologies often driven by the digital along with advances in material science and processes. The digital technology adopted in weaving industry has greatly enhanced production efficiency. However, we have compromised many artistic and colour values in weaving as the application of yarn colours is restricted by the performance characteristics of existing electronic Jacquard machinery. \nWe have been exploring the physiological optical illusion of juxtaposed primary-coloured yarns to overcome the current limitations in woven textile coloration. Over the last 10 years extensive weaving experiments have been conducted to examine various colour theories to introduce woven colour effects we have never seen before. Novel weaving methods have been developed through applying varied colour theories and digital image processing. \nThrough this exhibition, we introduce the first kind woven Jacquard textile designs that encompass colour, material, and texture initiation to make a valuable contribution to change and improve current woven textile coloration and design methods.",
