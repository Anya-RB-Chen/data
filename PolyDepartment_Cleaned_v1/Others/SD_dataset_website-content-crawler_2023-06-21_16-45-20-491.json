  "text": "Welcome to our world! \nPolyU Design is where we turn inspiration into life-changing innovation. As a student, alumni, teacher, or researcher we seek to constantly help people through design, and build the next generation of creators, community organizers, and leaders.\nCreate Possibilities. It is a motto that defines everything we do at PolyU Design. Our students, alumni and teaching community live and breathe this every single day. Our design work has a focus on making communities and lives better, and student projects constantly reflect this ethos. Students are not simply designing objects, but complex systems for society, ecology and economies. Interdisciplinary education, technology, redefined services and products for our age, and human and nature centred solutions form the concentration of what we do.\nPeople, communities and the earth. Our values are what drive us. We strive to develop open minds, steer positive change, establish visionary entrepreneurship, practice authentic expression, and design responsibly. While many think of design as pure aesthetics, we teach our students to view design through the lens of the community, and understand the impact of design on people. Our teaching reflects this transformation: designers have changed from primarily working individually to now working as teams, and we embrace this new era.\nSuccess comes together. We are not individuals, but rather, a collective. The School of Design has a rich heritage. Our belief is that excellent schools are built by communities. Indeed, our history and identity comes from the explosion of design that happened in the 1960s, and the emergence of Hong Kong’s industrious multinational business community.\nThe spirit of adventure. We constantly move forward into the new era of redefined products and services for the Hong Kong economy. PolyU Design has continued to build upon this ethos, within a new era of Hong Kong dynamism where we have a free economy fueling ambitious, risk-taking talent from our School. Our alumni contribute to communities daily, we never stand alone, and always link back to communities. This spirit of adventure, exploration and drive is exemplified by the likes of Dr Rebecca Lee Lok Sze, our alumna who became the world’s first woman explorer to leave her footprint in the Arctic, Antarctica and Mount Everest. Her can-do spirit highlights our lead to develop Hong Kong as a design knowledge hub through research, energy and pure grit.\nFostering talent. We seek to nurture our students with competitive, holistic and multidisciplinary academic inquiry, building critical thinking; innovation and creativity. And what better place to do this than Hong Kong, and its global community of talented teachers, researchers and students? With strong creative industries, we are able to attract more and more visionaries to build this city, and our School as a nexus for design, bolstered by strong funded operational spending and investment into research. Let’s make a brighter future!\nCo-creating a better world. Ready to be part of our family? We welcome you with open arms, and look forward to solving some of the world’s most urgent and challenging problems, together.\nSincerely,\nProf. Kun-pyo Lee, Dean of School of Design\nAdmissions | Job Vacancies | Sustainable Development Goals | Scholarships – Become a member of CRITS – The Collective for Recognizing Impact and Transformations by Students",

  "text": "The Architecture\nThe Jockey Club Innovation Tower (JCIT) is home to PolyU's School of Design and is the new driving force in the development of Hong Kong as a design hub in Asia.\nThe Tower is located at the northeastern tip of the university campus. Construction work began in 2009 and the whole project was completed in August, 2013. It has 15,000 square metres of net floor area and can accommodate about 1,800 staff and students. It houses a lecture hall, 10 classrooms, design studios and workshops, as well as exhibition spaces and a communal viewing lounge.\nThe Design\n“The fluid character of the Innovation Tower is generated through an intrinsic composition of its landscape, floor plates and louvers that dissolves the classic typology of the tower and the podium into an iconic seamless piece. These fluid internal and external courtyards create new public spaces of an intimate scale which complement the large open exhibition forums and outdoor recreational facilities to promote a diversity of civic spaces.” \n– Zaha Hadid (1950-2016), Architect, Innovation Tower\n\t\n\nUrbanism\nPolyU is an urban endeavor by virtue of addition and growth over the last 70 years. The rich patchwork of various faculties, communities and facilities are strung together by a community of visually coherent yet different buildings. From a process of outward expansion, the PolyU is now looking inwards to develop itself by making creative use of its remaining void on the northern side of the campus. The Innovation Tower aims to use these voids to create an accessible urban space which will transform how the PolyU is perceived and the way it will be used. The building unashamedly aims to stimulate and protect a vision-of-possibilities for its future, as well as reflect the history of the PolyU by encapsulating in its architecture the process of change.\nArchitecture\nThe vision of the Jockey Club Innovation Tower presents a unique opportunity to reexamine and address a creative, multidisciplinary environment. The design concept, in its first instance, collects the variety of programs of the school. Having undergone a strict process of examination of the multiple relationships amongst their unique identities they have been arranged in accordance to their ‘collateral flexibilities’.\nPriority lies in the drawing in of the campus staff, students and public into a welcoming new space that acts as both the building’s entrance and organizer for the existing complex. Podium level of the new Innovation Tower is established as an open public foyer that channels deep into the building through a column-free, open showcase forum.\nThe long integrated path from Suen Chi Sun Memorial Square guides visitors to the main entrance and from here, a generous and welcoming space openly provides access to supporting facilities (such as shops, cafeteria and museum) through its generous series of open exhibitions and ‘showcase spaces’.\nFrom the entry foyer, a long escalator penetrates deep upwards through openly glazed void to teaching spaces above. The myriad of workspaces accommodated within the new building offer themselves as a variety of visual showcases. The route through the building becomes a clear upward cascade of showcases and events allowing the student or visitor to visually covet and engage work and exhibits throughout its circulation passage. These routes aim to promote new opportunities of interaction between the diverse types of users through its spaces on every level. Voids bring in natural daylight, fresh air and the sense of continuity of space. In this way, the programmes of the tower, which comprise of learning clusters and central facilities, are allowed to create coordinated repertoires and dialogue between respective volumes of space.\nEnd Users\nAll of us pass by buildings, enter buildings, live and work in buildings. Products of the construction industry affect everyone and a decision is therefore needed in each project about the extent to which people outside the immediate scope should be involved. For the Innovation Tower project, this is one of the purposes of consultation with prospective end-users: to undergo a process taking into account of the environment and potential impact that it will have on the new school of design and the campus as a whole. Because so many people are affected in so many different ways, it is important to develop approaches which take account of some of these affects. Feedback from progressive iterations would shed light and enhance development in so that the Innovation Tower responds effectively to its environment.\nArchitectural Awards\nRIBA Award for International Excellence 2016\nIconic Award (Architecture)\nCommendation of Merit, Structural Excellence Awards Hong Kong\nShortlisted entry, 2014 My 10 Most Liked Hong Kong Architecture of the Century\nFinalist, CTBUH 2014 Best Tall Building Awards for the Asia & Australasia Region \nShortlisted entry, World Architecture Festival 2014 awards\nThe most anticipated buildings of 2014, Architectural Digest\nTOP 10 educational facilities of 2013, designboom\n2011 Autodesk Hong Kong BIM Award\nJCIT Directory\nSee also: Facilities\n13/F\tDean’s Office\nInnovation Think Tank\t\n\tV1301 School of Design Dean’s Office\nV1310 Innovation Think Tank\t\n\t\t\n12/F\tJockey Club Design Institute for Social Innovation\t\n\tV1201 Social Innovation Lecture Space\nV1210 Do Ground\nV1211 Lookout\nV1213 Work Space\nV1214 Centre for Innovation Programmes for Adolescents and Families\nV1215 Work Space\nV1216 Work Space\nV1217 Meeting Space\nV1218 Jockey Club Design Institute for Social Innovation\t\n\t\t\n11/F\tPostgraduate Programmes\t\n\tV1101 V1120 Lecture rooms\nV1102 V1121-1124 Postgraduate studios\t\n\t\t\n10/F\tEnvironment & Interior Design\nPostgraduate Programmes\t\n\tV1001 V1003 Meeting rooms\nV1002 Academic staff offices\nV1012 Project room\nV1013 Urban Environments Lab\nV1014 V1020 Postgraduate studios\nV1021-1024 Environment & Interior Design studios\t\n\t\t\n9/F\tDigital Media\nInteractive Media\t\nV901 V904 Meeting rooms\nV902 V910 Academic staff offices\nV912 Creativity and Design Education Lab\nV913 Teaching resource room\nV914 Teaching studio\nV915 Computer studio\nV920 Digital Entertainment Lab\nV921 V922 Interactive Media studio\nV923 V924 Digital Media studio\n8/F\n\tGeneral Office\nDigital Print Shop\n\tV801 Video conference room\nV802 Marketing and administrative staff offices\nV810 School of Design General Office\nV812 IT support office\nV813 Teaching studio\nV814 V820 Computer studios\nV821 Digital print shop\n7/F\n\tProduct Design\nV701 V715 V716 Seminar rooms\nV702 Academic staff offices\nV703 V717 Meeting rooms\nV710 Social Design studio\nV711 V712 Asian Ergonomics Design Lab\nV713 V714 Asian Lifestyle Design Lab\nV720-722 Product Design studios\nV723 Foundation Year studio\n6/F\tCommunication Design Researchers’ Office\nV601 Seminar room\nV602 Academic staff offices\nV603 V617 Meeting rooms\nV610 Researchers’ office\nV611 V612 Interaction Design Lab\nV613 V614 Research Centre for Future (Caring) Mobility\nV616 Public Design Lab\nV620-622 Communication Design studios\nV623 Foundation Year studio\n5/F\n\tAdvertising Design\nMaterial Resource Centre\nV501 Seminar room\nV502 Academic staff offices\nV503 V514 V515 Meeting rooms\nV510 Material Resource Centre\nV512 Information Design Lab\nV513 Computer studio\nV520-522 Advertising Design studios\nV523 Foundation Year studio\n4/F\n\tInnovation Collaboratory\n\tV401 Project room\nV402 Design for Assistive Technology and Education (DATE) Collaborative Space\nV410-415 Project rooms\nPolyU InnoHub\n3/F\n\tLecture Theatre\n\tV302-304 Classrooms\nV311-316 Classrooms\nV321 Classroom\nV322 Lecture theatre\nPodium\tPodium Exit\nInnovation Gallery\n\tFoyer Gallery\nInnovation Gallery\n1/F\n\tProduction Workshops\n\tV101 V104 Model making workshops\nV102 Design Fab Lab\nV123 Technicians’ office\nV103 Electronics prototyping workshop\nV105 Laser cutting workshop\nV110 Electroencephalograph studio\nV111 3D Printing Workshop\nV112 Future Design I Joint Lab\nV113 Sound suite\nV120 Stop motion studio\nV121 Animation studio\nV122 Media control room\nV130 Sound mixing studio\nV133 Sound studio\nV134 Screening room\nG/F\n\tProduction Workshops & Living Lab\n\tV010 Photography studio\nV011 Colour management studio\nV012 Dimmer room\nV020 Media production studio\nV031 PolyU Sports Team Centre\nV040 Metal and wood workshop\nV050 Living Lab\nVenue Booking\nLocated at the podium level of the Jockey Club Innovation Tower (JCIT) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Innovation Gallery comprises three individual art galleries.

Research Themes\nResearch at the School of Design is grounded in an understanding of design as a social activity that: [a] involves collaboration and sharing among diverse people, [b] is embedded in societies and cultures, [c] gives expression to ideals and values of society, [d] critically explores and interrogates issues in society and [d] goes beyond the design professions.\nMoreover, the School research has gravitated towards exploring these social dimensions of design within three distinct realms:\na) Social Design (設計社會學): \ncollaborative design with communities to improve their lives through participatory, theoretical and critical approaches\nb) Design Economy (設計經濟學): \ncollaborative design that enhances the role of design in innovation and value creation in the private sector\nc) Design Making (設計製造學):\nuser-centred design investigations with communities and practices of making, such as the “maker movement,” with technological, organizational as well as sociological facets.\nThis work happens in the School’s research centres and research labs:\nResearch Centre for Future (Caring) Mobility \nAsian Lifestyle Design Lab\nDigital Entertainment Lab\nPublic Design Lab\nAsian Ergonomics Design Lab\nCreativity and Design Education Lab\nInformation Design Lab\nInteraction Design Lab\nEach theme is based on the established experience and expertise of the School of Design and its researchers.

After finishing high school in mainland China, he decided to begin his journey to become a designer in Hong Kong. We had a chat with him to peek into a PolyU design student’s study life. Follow through our chat and see if PolyU Design is your next destination. \nGrace Moon’s PolyU Delegation Trip to South Korea\nGrace Daeun Moon, a Year 3 Communication Design student from PolyU Design had the chance to accompany the university’s senior management in a visit to South Korea last month, taking up the role of the sole student ambassador. She sat down with us for a chat right after the trip, sharing the details of this eye-opening journey.\nIntern experiences \nThroughout the years, students have gone out into the world to gain professional and practical experience through internships, in preparation to become young designers after graduation. Here, you’ll find some of our students’ stories and experiences of internship.\nAdvertising Communication Environment & Interior Product ",

Benefits for your participation include:\nGetting new ideas\nStudent interns approach new projects with enthusiasm and are eager to apply their creativity and knowledge to work. Being young and relatively new to the workplace could be an advantage, students are able to provide fresh perspectives\nGaining additional resources for your high to medium priority projects\nOur students are enthusiastic designers who could supplement your existing workforce at reasonable costs. Training allowance is at the discretion of the host organisation and the costs of hiring interns are generally much less than hiring additional full-time employee.\nAccess to young design talents who could become your employees\nMany organisations hire interns as full-time employees after graduation. Internship presents an opportunity to observe potential candidates’ interaction with your team. It could also enhance the leadership and management skills of your permanent staff through the process of guiding interns. Your involvement is important for the development of our next generation of designers.\nContact Persons\nJosephine Cheung | Erica Lam\nEmail sd.info@polyu.edu.hk",

  "text": "Our History of Research\nSix Design Research narratives summarises PolyU Design’s past research incentives. PolyU Design has made a substantial contribution to society in three main research areas: Asian ergonomics and lifestyle (stories 1-2); universal design (stories 3-4); and creative art work (stories 5-6). Meant as reference, they provide details on the School’s work on, amongst others; 3D printing, Asian lifestyle research, ageing within the South East Asia and multimedia research and production as part of the School of Design legacy and design endeavours. \n(1) Embracing a new wave of industrialisation from 3D scanning to 3D printing\nFew design research stories are more compiling than that of SizeChina, led by Professor Roger Ball in the School of Design of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, whose development of an ergonomic database of Chinese populations has gain worldwide recognition in a surprisingly short period of time, with numerous awards and prizes, including the prestigious award by the Industrial Design Society of America. The crucial factor for the success of the project was that its problems and contexts for research were identified by Dr. Ball, a designer by background. The research was driven by a creative design process in which designers’ instinct played a decisive role on identifying the nature of the research problem and the need for stylish and ergonomic differentiation based on concrete scientific data of qualitative nature in the products to be designed for users. The successfully integrated technology for 3D scanning of ergonomic data of Chinese populations was not the end of the story. Rather, it was the beginning to break a new ground for more exciting and ambitious attempts in new research and new designs that link will 3D scanning directly with 3D printing. This will change the process of design and making with greater possibility for creativity and innovation in design beyond Chinese populations. \n(2) Life styles and sustainability leading the way for product, system and social innovation\nThe Asian life style research laboratory in the School of Design of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University led by Mr. Benny Leong has become an attractive centre for user centered research for leading giant high-tech players in China such as Huawei (Beijing and Shenzhen), and major domestic appliances company such as Philips and Cuckoo. Over the years, Asian life style laboratory has recorded a large number of stories of life of Chinese families across Chinese Mainland. These story cases gave clear paths of the evolving life styles of people, which in turn, provided guidance and principles on the creation of products, systems, accommodations, transports, and services for an innovative and sustainable future in China and Asia. Benny Leong, as a talented designer who once worked in Phillips, provided a designer’s perspective and high aesthetic standards in transforming the research data of life styles into product guidelines and evaluation criteria. The laboratory has also linked the School of Design to the Milan based International Association for Design for Social Innovation and Sustainability, and to leading design institutions in mainland China for a joint international effort on the research in design for sustainable life styles and environments. \n(3) From a local expert to the Champion of Universal Design of Helen Hamlyn Center\nProfessor Michael Siu served many local design organisations and engaged himself in design activities applying his knowledge and expertise to the problems in public space and public furniture in Hong Kong. He was considered as a local hero, who embraced the challenges and tackled the design issues benefiting the community. He once served as the Chairman of Hong Kong Toilet Association. Many of his designs have now been implemented by local organisations and authorities, which have produced design patents and won awards, based on his research findings and design projects. Through his academic involvement in the School of Design of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, he generalised practical design knowledge into the principles of universal design which can be applied to similar problems in other regions. As a result, he was awarded the Champion of Universal Design, by the Royal College of Art in the UK, which is one of the world’s top design schools in research on universal design. He is the first Asian researcher awarded with this title. This is a typical story of how academic research can be integrated with practical design requiring strong local characters and knowledge, resulting in internationally recognised achievements for the contributions to a field of design with convincing academic and scholarly qualities. \n(4) Creating excellence in the research of active aging where both local and international design needs converge\nActive aging is a design research topic where both international relevance and local urgency converge. Dr Jackie Kwok has been working in this area throughout her career in the last 20 years. Her passion and focus on the elderly living culture in HK, mainland China, and the region have gained her wide recognition beyond local or regional standing. Her research was guided by rigorous methodologies and approaches with international standard. In the meantime, her advantage of local experience of working with large numbers of elderly and institutions created unique and valuable case studies and findings that can also influence international design research communities in this challenging aging problem facing the world. Among many of her publication of books on design for the elderly, is a recent book on “Humanistic Gerontology: New Direction of the Ageing Society”. In this book she aimed at achieving a unified standard for scholarly research output on the topic of aging. It provided fresh stories of Hong Kong elderly people in their struggles to cope with aging problems, for the researchers in the same field in the Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China for their pursuit of better design solutions to the problems. Her story is that of a highly focused research, which tackled the universal problem of active aging with historic and philosophical design thinking. \n(5) Creating a virtual design world of creative minds, young hearts and explorative spirits in multimedia research and production\nHung Keung is a local icon in creative media for young design students. His endless list of creative work, ranging from video, film, digital installation, computer simulation, is firmly based on the research on the integration of technology, art and design, influenced by the highly dynamic life styles and urban culture of Hong Kong. His virtual world is full of characters of stunning visual impacts, often resulting from explorations in storytelling and technical experimentations. His work is shown in many ranging from Hong Kong to Portland USA, and from Shanghai to Jordan. The highly creative impact produced by his artwork has been achieved with a good research on the state of the art technologies and on the contents that differentiate his innovative touch on visualisation and interactions with others. His work always contained strong and unique local characters, but he also impressed the global research community on media arts by his strong commitment to challenging the limitations of the technologies. In recent years, his contributions to the art world in Hong Kong and beyond have been highly recognised by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, and Hong Kong Home Affairs Council. In 2010, he was the recipient of the best artist award in Hong Kong. \n(6) Design leadership through creative culture industries in western China\nThe School of Design played a leadership role in the collaboration between The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Xian Jiaotong University on the joint Research Centre on Creative Culture Industries for Western China. The rich cultural resources and heritages in western China provided inspirations for the local design professionals and design students including PhD students in their attempts to create high level brands with strong cultural identities. Professor Ming Xi Tang led the team in the production of a documentary “The Masters of Faces” in March 2014 with overwhelming acclaims and responses from the mass in western China. An exhibition on “Heaven and People in One, Generation by Generation – Shaanxi Culture and Design Innovation” was held in May 2014 in the Innovation Tower. This exhibition involved 11 handicrafts masters and artists of national standing in western China. It attracted the participation and collaboration of a major international association of Ars Mathematica in France, a pioneer in the world on research in digital sculpture and 3D printing. This adventure is to be continued in Rome, Italy in December 2014, with an invitation from International Conference on Generative Art, which promotes the integration of art and computing in an evolutionary approach to generating new products and systems for future.\nSee also: Research & PolyU Design | Design Labs | Research Centre for Future (Caring) Mobility",

  "text": "Initiative 2: Design Economy\nKey Words\tDesign Business, Innovation, Applied Research, SD Research Community, Industry Collaboration, Research Agenda, Consumer-centric Focus, Research-to-Practice, Practice-to-Research \t\nCo-ordinator\tDr Joern Buehring [joern.buehring@polyu.edu.hk]\t\nThis initiative forms part of a broader ambition to create a stronger connection between PolyU Design’s research community and its engagement with industry. By promoting multi-disciplinary, collaborative, and applied research activities, the motivation is to create a greater impact in design business and innovation - of specific interest to academic, social, and business communities.\nWhy is design business and innovation as a focused approach to research so important? Companies that value design innovate more often, and those who do - innovate more successfully. Moreover, firms that integrate design more strategically within their organisations, experience greater demand for their product, service, experience propositions. \nInnovation requires a fast and empathetic approach to research in order to see and act on the nuances that empower better and sustainable futures. To achieve high-impact design solutions, however, researchers, experts, designers and business stakeholders have to work together through e.g. demand definition, fieldwork, analysis, and interpretation. While inquiring about consumer needs, wants, desires and expectations – only together they learn to discover meaning and potential – leading to opportunity visualisation and innovation.\nTaking a consumer-centric approach to design business innovation, a research community approach is proposed: Here, like-motivated faculty members engage around a comprehensive and cohesive research agenda by identifying the current gaps in the SD Research and Engagement Innovation System. To be successful, the approach taken needs to ensure that the Design Business and Innovation community conducts research with purpose, relevance and foresight in real-world settings. Specifically, the mission is to:\nAgree on gaps and priority research areas [applied / basic]\nTo embed research activities in a holistic structure [knowledge, learning, doing, validating]\nTo match up cooperations that allow access to ‘real-world’ settings [via curriculum, tailored projects, and collaboration initiatives] \nTo establish and communicate a clear research profile / direction [internal / external]\nTo produce “research-to-practice” and “practice-to-research” demonstration outputs\nTo focus on accelerating innovation: e.g. application of knowledge to generate economic value through design-driven innovation [e.g. methods, processes, models, frameworks, tools]\nTo transfer knowledge into [economic] value generation by organizations\nTo collaborate with organizations [applied research] where the industry informs the agenda\nTo develop new learning platforms that are multi-disciplinary and team-based [e.g. UBS]\nSupporting Members:\nDr Jorn Buhring\nDr Vincie Lee\nDr Sylvia Liu\nProjects, ongoing research and research papers on Design Economy can be found here.\nInitiative 3: Design Making\n\"Making\" can be defined as turning ideas into reality, which involves manipulation of materials into perceivable/tangible form through tools and processes. The context of making can be classified as amateur and professional. While professional making encompasses prototyping and model making and has been an integral part of design practice, amateur making is mostly discussed in an academic context as do-it-yourself (DIY). Atkinson (2006) describes DIY as “self-driven, self-directed amateur design and production activity carried out more closely to the end user of the goods created”, while other describe DIYers as “craft consumer” (Campbell, 2005), “producing-consumer” (Brown, 2008) and \"amateur designers and makers\" (Jackson, 2010). In fact, “making” implies different consumption behaviour which impacts on product design (e.g. DIY products for a low-income family to enhance the quality of life (Dos Santos, 2010)) as well as professional practice (e.g. interactions between professional and amateur homebuilders (Brown, 2008)).\nWhile DIY is associated with activities being done alone or in small groups in physical proximity, “making” is more appropriately described as “DIY with others” and “DIY with technologies”, thanks to increasing democratisation of knowledge and technologies in recent years. In the past two decades, the Internet has been providing a versatile and free platform for people to connect and share, making “DIY with others” increasingly easy. Nowadays, it is possible for an individual to make something on her own, share a tutorial online to others on how she made it, and another person from another part of the world learns and refines the process to adapt to her own use. We can also order materials/components online through eCommerce websites for us to assemble locally. Two notable areas of development which contribute to “DIY with technologies” are commons-based peer production (Bencher and Nissenbaum, 2006), and digital fabrication (Gershenfeld, 2012). In particular, open source software development (a form of commons-based peer production) leads to free or low-cost high-quality software (e.g. 3D modelling software) which helps individuals to design and make, while digital fabrication offers low-cost machineries for small-scale production or even desktop manufacturing. This facilitates individual who can make to design and innovate, possibly collaborating with people locally and around the world, and providing solutions to niche markets. With crowd-funding and crowd-sourcing and social media, this has been making big changes to how business operates and our innovation ecosystem. Indeed, Hagel, et al (2014) observe the increasing fragmentation of business and innovation, and that there will be an increasing amount of grassroots businesses being enabled and empowered by few large-scale platforms. \nIndeed, meanings of “making” to individual, communities and societies are evolving as technologies progress, and are affecting us in our well-being, education, consumption pattern, innovation ecosystem, sustainability, and technological and economic development. While “design thinking” (Dorst, 2011) focuses more on thinking and understanding aspects of design, we define “design making” as one which focuses more on the “making” aspects in design, including the understanding of the ever-evolving meaning of “making” towards individual, communities and societies.\nSupporting Members:\nDr Clifford Choy\nDaniel Elkin\nBenny Leong\nDr Yan Tina Luximon\nProjects, ongoing research and research papers on Design Making can be found here.",

  "text": "Introduction\nCurrent PhD Work\nApplication\nMeet our PhD advisors\nHistorically PolyU Design’s PhD programme commenced with a strong focus on digital design technology during the nineties. Since then, the programme has expanded into several directions, including social design, management, media design, universal design, as well as design studies, culminating in a diversity of research work, comprised out of a 50 strong student body of whom mostly conduct research on a part-time basis.\nAs set out under the initiatives, all PhD research is encouraged to link to the three distinct themes of Social Design, Design Economy and Design Making.\nOver and above the mandatory requirements of completing 15 credits coursework, each PhD thesis has to produce an independently authored PhD thesis document as proof of the creation of new knowledge fields within the various domains of enquiry. In order to facilitate [a] research process, [b] independent thinking and [c] critical engagement the School of Design requires each PhD student to participate in biannual seminars organised in the format of a PhD Winter and Summer Schools.\nPhD Seminars are doctoral seminars organised by PhD student’s committee and driven by their research interest and progress. Enabled by technology, we can now connect the global community on Zoom from wherever we are. The PhD Seminar Series 2020/21 has provided an unprecedented platform to engaged the following speakers on an interactive form of knowledge sharing and critiques.\nCurrent PhD research:\nGUAN, Jing\tA Design Toolkit for Visually Impaired People on Travelling Experience.\t\nIP, Chung Man (Tony)\tUrban Living with Sky Gardens\t\nJIANG, Ying \tAgeing at Home: An Exploration of the Meaning of 'Home' for Care Design.\t\nKING, Pui Yuk (Alex)\tUniversal Product Design for Elderly Living: A Comparative Case Study of User Behavior between Elderly Living Alone and in Residential Care Homes in Hong Kong.\t\nLI, Yang (Karen)\n\tCultural Integration as a New Path for Reforming Design Education in China.\t\nLIU, Helene\tSelf-Reflexivity as a pathway to nurture and sustain individual creative processes in the context of innovation and design.\t\nNASKOVA, Julija\tComparative studies of interactive systems that enhance user experience and marketing results on the cloud, with emphasis on Cross Cultural Differences Between China and the USA. \t\nNG, Po Choy\tComputational Design System for Brand Identity.\t\nWANG, Shisi\tCreating the Online Images of Cities Populated with Chinese Ethinic Groups: Taking Tibetan Cities as an Example.\t\nNAVARRO, Louie T. \tThe Perfection of the Interior Render: Reconsidering Representations in Interior Design and its Impact on Thinking, Practice, and Policy.\t\nPENG, Yixuan\tEcological Conflicts in Chinese Megablock Urbanism -

  "text": "Dr Tulio Maximo\nBachelor of Science in Industrial Design, Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, Brazil (2006)\nMaster of Science in Ergonomics – Inclusive Design, Loughborough University, UK (2012)\nDoctor of Philosophy in Disability Studies, Loughborough University, UK (2017)\nAssistant Professor, PolyU School of Design (2018 – present)\n“PolyU’s School of Design (SD) offered me an opportunity that I always dreamed of, which is to engage in student-centric education and inclusive design,” says Dr Tulio Maximo, Assistant Professor at SD, as he reflects on why he decided to join the School in 2018. He adds, “The School’s vision to nurture open-minded creative leaders who make a positive impact also corresponds with my own values and inspired me to join this world-class School”.\nSuccess met with failures\nSince joining SD, Dr Maximo has created an elective course focusing on inclusive design called “Design meets Disabilities”, which applies empathy to guide students to design more user-friendly products, especially for people with disabilities. In particular, he encourages his students to develop a personal understanding of users' needs, by collaborating with potential users throughout the design process, starting from research and conceptualisation to product testing. He also equips students with tools to immerse themselves as an elderly or disabled person, simulating reduction of capabilities faced by this population and thinking about what kind of products would be suitable for them.\nDr Maximo’s passion to promote empathy and inclusion is partly motivated by the example of his mother, who was a public-school teacher in Brazil. His mother was committed to helping and teaching others regardless of their background or personal circumstances. In fact, she went out of her way to help the most disadvantaged members of society. This spirit of serving others inspired Dr Maximo to do likewise through practising inclusive design. His own childhood diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder also made him an advocate of inclusive education, which means providing a learning experience that respects students’ neurodiversity (or difference in cognitive behaviours).\nAs a result of his devotion to inclusive design and education, Dr Maximo was presented with the prestigious 2022 UGC Teaching Award in the Early Career Faculty Members category, one of only three recipients this year. Please refer to page 23 to learn more about this award.\nDesign is thriving in Hong Kong\nSince moving to Hong Kong after completing his PhD in the UK, Dr Maximo claims, “I greatly admire the design culture in Hong Kong. I think inclusive design is really valued here.” He commends the local Government for promoting inclusive design through collaborative projects with the community. One example is the playground in Tuen Mun Park which was designed collaboratively with potential users, including children and seniors to make the playground user-oriented. He’s also encouraged by SD students tackling social issues through their capstone projects or other design initiatives.\nInclusive design generates social and economic value\nIn Asia, Dr Maximo has been influenced by innovators such as Yohji Yamamoto, a Japanese fashion designer who has for decades been making gender-neutral clothes that can be worn by both men and women, thus pioneering inclusive design in the fashion industry. He’s also impressed by the work of PolyU SD alumnus Dr Rico Chan, who founded a social enterprise called Beyond Vision Projects that aims to enhance the quality of life for visually impaired people. Whereas Comma Leung, an SD alumna, founded Mosi Mosi, a design studio which creates people-oriented products, including a wallet for visually impaired persons and a coin-purse for people with cerebral palsy. These examples, according to Dr Maximo, illustrate that inclusive design is not only socially beneficial, but can also be economically viable as a business. He hopes they inspire more designers at PolyU and in Hong Kong to champion user-centric design.\nSignificant personal projects\nIn terms of his own projects, Dr Maximo is proud of a project called Ciranda, which he undertook in Brazil at the Instituto Noisinho da Silva. Ciranda helps young children with physical disabilities to sit independently on the floor, enabling them to play and learn and interact with other children through a specially designed floor seat. Not only was this seat produced and commercialised, but parents from poor backgrounds who couldn’t afford one were trained how to build their own seats, making Dr Maximo realise that design is not just about building products, but can also be about providing a service for the benefit of the community.\nThe Omni Study System\nAt PolyU, Dr Maximo is honoured to lead the multi-disciplinary ‘Omni Study System’ project, commissioned by the Jockey Club Design Institute for Social Innovation. This project comprises a low cost but systematic furniture solution including a folding table with divisor panel and integrated light; a seat that can be used on the bed, on the floor or on a stool; a tilt board; a storage bag; a set of cushions and a footrest to fit children of different sizes. The furniture system provides an optimal studying space for children in sub-divided flats to support their healthy development. The project won the prestigious Red Dot Award: Product Design 2022.\nAn enriching education\nDr Maximo teaches his students ergonomics and inclusive design.\nUltimately, Dr Maximo wants his students to find their studies joyful and directed towards the well-being of others. He calls this ‘value-creation education’, a term originally coined by the Japanese educator Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and disseminated by the Japanese educator and philosopher Daisaku Ikeda. “I’m driven to provide happy and meaningful moments for my students, so that they leave my lessons feeling enriched and inspired,” Dr Maximo explains, as he strives to nurture the next generation of user-centric designers.\nArticle extracted from:\n“Dr Tulio Maximo - Design that makes a difference: fostering inclusion and empathy”, Excel x Impact",

  "text": "Materials / Designers Exhibition Extended! \nWe're excited to announce that due to popular demand, the \"Materials/Designers Exhibition\" will be extended until 29 Oct 2023! Don’t miss your chance to see our alumni’s amazing works created with different materials.\nSlasher is an emerging term coined for those with multiple careers, referring to the numerous ‘slashes’ in their work title enumerating their different job abilities. The idea of slashing suggests that young people no longer confine themselves to a single position. Multiple careers allow them to pursue various interests and a more satisfactory work-life balance. \n“Materials / Designers” reflects the idea of slashing by displaying designers’ liberating relationships with different materials. The Material Resource Centre of PolyU Design invited seven young designers, the alumni of PolyU Design at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, to create artwork for the exhibition. These young designers achieved outstanding accomplishments and received numerous awards during their studies, and now, they have unleashed their potential in various fields of design. For this material-themed exhibition, each designer has produced artwork using a single material, from the traditional, including paper, Hong Kong reclaimed wood and acrylic, to new intelligent panels such as OLED and a biological agent, yeast. Each material has unique characteristics. With this exhibition, the Material Resource Centre of PolyU Design hopes to show the designers’ insights into these materials, allowing visitors to understand their relationships and explore the materials’ possibilities.\nThe exhibition showcased 7 works made by representative materials of their designers, who are School of Design alumni.\nPublic Visit\nExternal visitors of the exhibition are required to register at least two working days in advance.\n“Materials / Designers” Exhibition Sharing 「物料/設計師」展覽分享會",

Wang, Director of Research Centre for Future (Caring) Mobility of PolyU, Dr. Cyriel Diels, Deputy Director of Intelligent Mobility Design Centre, RCA, Ms Herin Haramoto, Mr Yichen Shu, Research Associates of IMDC, and Ms Yaqi Zhang, PhD Student, SD, PolyU, the workshop was designed to allow students to freely explore the possibilities of building novel relationship between a person and an autonomous vehicle. \nProf Stephen J. Wang emphasised that “One of the key themes of the workshop was the importance of designing for human-vehicle interactions and user experience. this workshop was well aligned with our Research Center (RC-FCM)’s vision ‘to tackle on the ‘wicked’ real-world challenges such as the future caring in transportation, transit UX, communication and integration of personal information in mobility, automobile cybersecurity, and UX in emerging transport modes, and wellbeing aspects in connected and autonomous vehicles.’\nMultifaceted exercises and activities including bodystorming, user-journey plotting, and design evaluation were involved in the workshop. Students were fully engaged in the thinking process, from brainstorming to performing their results from bodystorming.\nThe workshop is part of a research project co-conducted by PolyU and RCA entitled ‘Design for Autonomous Mobility’. Funded by AiDlab, the project aims to explore the experience of future autonomous vehicles, which are in the absence of steering wheels and pedals and will be driven by themselves. The workshop has provided a valuable platform for participants to share knowledge, exchange ideas, and collaborate on innovative design solutions for autonomous mobility.\nBy fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between the two world-leading human-centred Research Centres, the workshop has evidenced how such international collaboration could drive forward new approaches to designing for autonomous mobility and create a more user-friendly and efficient transportation system for the future.",

  "text": "BA(Hons) Scheme in Design: Cross-discipline FAQs\nAn easy answer could be encapsulated in one word: AP-PLI-CA-TION: a design serves a purpose, one that is linked to context. Whereas designers need to appreciate context to provide appropriate solutions to given briefs, they will brought to rationalize their proposals and justify their solutions. Artists may virtually propose to “take it or leave it”. Also, designers work with stakeholders – the user being the most important. Artists have the liberty to express a very personal take on the world, and relate to their own emotions and ideas to shape their work. \nApplicants are expected to attain a minimum 3 Score in their English and Chinese subjects at the HKDSE. \nWe accept JUPAS applicants on the basis of potential, not acquired knowledge or skills, hence the presentation of a portfolio at interviews, although recommended, being optional. If you have a portfolio, we will seek to discern:\nif you have taken the initiative to sketch out of your interest (evidence of personal passion for creativity, expression, problem-solving, manipulation, etc.)\nthe scope of media explored (evidence of a taste for experimentation), \nif this has been consistent (through quantity of works, or visual diaries, scrap books, etc.)\nNote: JUPAS applicants are not required to bring a portfolio. JUPAS applicants who in interviews demonstrate critical thinking, critical awareness of the broader cultural context, awareness of design in general and awareness of the design discipline chosen will be considered for the programme. \nNot necessarily – We favour applicants who demonstrate critical thinking, critical awareness of the broader cultural context, and awareness of design in general and awareness of the design discipline chosen. \nGo to galleries, museums, bookstores like Page One and Basheer books, go online to find about design practice, processes, works, designers, etc… and see how design influences your everyday – you have almost two months!\nIn addition, you are advised to watch the series of videos produced to help you prepare your portfolios at here. \nWhile Visual Arts or Design and Applied Technology subjects have been designed to better prepare applicants to a design or art tertiary curriculum and career, this does not mean those who did not take these subjects cannot apply. They should be proactive and seek knowledge about their discipline of choice online, in galleries, in museums, in exhibitions, and at the School of Design. Personal initiative in making a portfolio is valued by admission panels. Personal drawings, collages, visual diaries, small home projects i.e. craft and tinkering are highly valued. \nBA(Hons) in Product Design FAQs\nOnly insofar as it helps you appreciate cultural issues and provide appropriate design solutions to given briefs. If you feel you need to improve your knowledge of science/technology/maths, you should be able to learn as you do. Designers learn by doing…\nThis is OK. Drawing is a technique. Techniques are learned through practice and perseverance. SD will support your acquisition of such skills.\nWhereas engineers favour control over the developmental processes, designers are involved in processes of transformation through inquiry and , defining problem and solution in an iterative development, not unlike a conversation. Designers shape the everyday and provide meaning to the artificial world. Designers and Engineers work together. \nIn aptitude tests we seek to gauge your motivation and awareness. We cannot give away questions, but as you can imagine we seek to find out how prepared you are for this programme, i.e. your motivation, your awareness of design in general, your awareness of your chosen design discipline, and how you contextualize this in the broader cultural realm. Of course the more original, creative, intelligent your answers the better. Surprise us! \nWe accept JUPAS applicants on the basis of potential, not acquired knowledge or skills, hence the presentation of a portfolio at interviews, although recommended, being optional. If you have a portfolio, we will seek to discern:\nif you have taken the initiative to sketch out of your interest (evidence of personal passion for creativity, expression, problem-solving, manipulation, etc.)\nthe scope of media explored (evidence of a taste for experimentation), \nif this has been consistent (through quantity of works, or visual diaries, scrap books, etc.)\nNote: JUPAS applicants are not required to bring a portfolio. JUPAS applicants who in interviews demonstrate critical thinking, critical awareness of the broader cultural context, awareness of design in general and awareness of the design discipline chosen will be considered for the programme.\nFor Product Design students, to the above you may add little things you made: any hobby or trinket you built in the past such as T shirts, fashion accessories, bags, toys, gifts, furniture, etc. Of course the more original, creative, intelligent your visual experiments the better.

  "text": "Objectives\nPolyU is the first university in Hong Kong that offers both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in service design education in response to the rapidly increasing global demands of service. The focus of Smart Service Design is beyond the scope of user experience design, information design, product design, or any other single output of design application; rather, it focuses on a broad design spectrum that integrates design, business, technology and human needs to create service solutions of tomorrow and bring new value to the service industry and society at large.\nThrough advanced service design methodologies, SSD offers a unique interdisciplinary educational environment that meets diverse learning needs and provides students with opportunities to reshape their own design practices. This specialism offers students to work and involve themselves in the creation of transformations and evaluations of service products and content across both digital and offline channels through lectures, studio learning, workshops and their capstone research projects.\nOur graduates will be equipped with the necessary professional skills to meet the demands of careers in the service industry. They will play different roles not only in conventional design-related professions, but also in management and strategy in various service sectors, such as consumer electronics, mobility, healthcare, tourism and hospitality, finance, public service and so on.",

  "text": "The relation between bodies and territories.\nGeographical navigations of both real and imaginary territories include processes and techniques of mapping, such as observation, collection, cataloging and representation; as well as strategic and tactical approaches to appropriation. Mapping, as a way to formulate a proposition, often results in a type of archive that develops a visual artifact that can communicate a primary intention, as well as a critical viewpoint. For instance, questions articulated around the limit of visibility and invisibility has become a dominant issue in our practice. With a focus on atmospheric conditions, the research often refers to Walter Benjamin’s concept of phantasmagoria or the spectacle of making ghosts come alive.\nMore recently, the development of fictions has become my primary mode to investigate these questions, towards the invention of new mythologies, using narration as a way to re-territorialize hyper-real environments. These fictions are documented through the use of drawing, photo or video documentation, and then are often communicated as narratives or performances.\nExpertise: Strategic Planning, Urban Environment, Relationship between Design, Art and Politics in Asia",

  "text": "Li Zihan, a Year-4 product design student, was selected as an awardee of PolyU’s Outstanding Student Award 2022 for his excellent academic performance at PolyU Design. After finishing high school in mainland China, he decided to begin his journey to become a designer in Hong Kong. We had a chat with Li Zihan to peek into a PolyU design student’s study life. Follow through our chat and see if PolyU Design is your next destination. \nQuestion 1. Why did you choose to study at PolyU Design?\nA: There are a few reasons. It starts with my background: A science student that always has a passion for art, I enjoyed drawing and making models since young. My interest in materialising ideas led me to choose the path of Product Design. My art portfolio built back then came in handy for the application of PolyU Design BA programme. \nThe high reputation and world ranking of the School were also the criteria I considered. Since I wanted to reach out to a more international and open platform, I decided to kick off my design journey in Hong Kong. PolyU Design has provided me with the global vision and exposure that I looked for in a design school. \nQuestion 2. List 3 things you find useful or inspiring about studying here\nRich learning resources\nA: From the well-equipped facilities to the experienced teaching staff, they make up a comprehensive and practical learning experience. Compared to my exchange college in Milan, PolyU Design has way better hardware, with studios, galleries and rooms fulfilling multi-purposes. For example, the Material Resource Centre has allowed me to learn about the characteristics of the materials and adopt them into my design. They have given me many inspirations through searching and touching the material samples. \nSTUDIO and fixed workspace\nA: Instead of moving around to different lecture rooms, we have our classes in a fixed classroom with our own working space. Studio is the place where we do almost everything, from taking classes and working on projects, to sleeping and having meals. It is a perfect place for us to engage with other students and exchange ideas. \nFrequent showcases and exhibitions\nA: Every few months or weeks, you can find new exhibitions at the podium galleries and other floors in the iconic Jockey Club Innovation Tower. This sets up an immersive design atmosphere. As I pass by the podium and corridors, I can always serendipitously find ideas from my peers’ works across different disciplines. It also feels like a significant recognition or encouragement to have your works showcased in exhibitions too.\nQuestion 3. Share one of your most unforgettable learning experiences in PolyU Design\nA: The most remarkable learning experience has to be the Co-operative Project and overseas internship. COOP Project was a great platform for practical experience. I worked on an interior design project in collaboration with Chinachem, the leading Hong Kong property developer. Having an actual client made the project realistic and rewarding. At the same time, it was exhausting with the heavy workload and big project group but the hard work paid off and I learnt a lot. \nCOOP Project moments with Chinachem, the leading Hong Kong property development\nOverseas Internship\nI took the chance to go on an overseas internship in Italy and worked at a furniture design studio, Sand & Birch Studio. Working overseas with professional furniture designers not only enriched my design skills but also broadened my horizons and nurtured my global vision. \nMoments from Li Zihan's overseas exchange experience\nQuestion 4. What is your plan after graduation?\nA: I will carry on my journey in Milan, to study a Master’s degree in design there. At this stage, my focus is on exploring my interests, capabilities, and the trends and demands of society, to fit myself into the right field. I wish to be an adventurous designer. \nI am lucky that my parents are supportive of my dreams and decisions, they wanted me to do something that I like and enjoy life. I wish the same for myself. I would devolve myself into a career that I’m passionate about even if it may not pay a lot.",

  "text": "Throughout the years, students have gone out into the world to gain professional and practical experience through internships, in preparation to become young designers after graduation. Here, you’ll find some of our students’ stories and experiences of internship.\nAdvertising / Communication / Environment & Interior / Product\nDiscipline: Advertising Design\nStudent: YOUNG Shuk Yi, Suye\nInternship Company: The Bread Digital, Hong Kong\nSuye was most intrigued by creative and art direction in the advertising industry when she first started thinking about internships. Her learning objectives were 1) to learn to get along with others and improve communication through teamwork, 2) to explore future career directions and 3) to learn different advertising design techniques and practices by understanding agencies’ actual production processes, and to work with real clients and campaigns.\nSuye was assigned to work in the Creative department, where she learnt about various client types, advertising strategies and approaches. The practical skills that she developed included being efficient in a professional environment, understanding clients’ briefs and requirements and completing her work on time. In addition to improving her software skills, Suye stimulated her own creative thinking skills during design processes, and constantly sought new ideas using various tools and channels.\nSuye’s team found her to have a high level of self-discipline and a proactive attitude, even when working remotely. Her strength in communication and her ability to consider different perspectives when developing her own thoughts made her a very co-operative and mature team player.\nSuye considered the internship to be a very valuable experience, and she treasured the improvement in her interpersonal communication the most. She was unafraid to ask questions, and improved her creative thinking, work attitude and time management – skills that she could not have learnt from books or solely in the classroom. She had a wonderful time with her colleagues, she especially loved the office environment and, most importantly, she gained deeper insights into the advertising industry.\nDiscipline: Communication Design\nStudent: LEUNG Stefanie Lok Yin\nInternship Company: Art Museum, CUHK, Hong Kong\nStefanie began her internship with an orientation of CUHK and a tour around the Art Museum. By the end of her first week, she had already learned to take initiative and not to be afraid to share her ideas with her supervisor. Another critical learning point for Stefanie was the importance of organisation as a form of visual communication, which helped her to manifest her design process in a more technical sense. Time management was initially a challenge for her, but she made improvements, setting up a work schedule for herself to manage work priorities.\nAmong her projects, Stefanie was asked to work on exhibition souvenirs and visual identity designs, which she tackled with societal, cultural and environmental issues in mind. As a future designer, she wanted to learn about responsible design decisions to meet both conceptual and sustainable needs.\nStefanie’s workplace supervisor thought that she exceeded expectations in the role of summer intern, and that she had a positive attitude and worked well under pressure. Stefanie also demonstrated enthusiasm and professionalism in all of her assignments, and her design proposals were excellent.\nStefanie was happy to learn that she had become more aware of her strengths and weaknesses by the end of this internship journey. She had improved in her ability to visualise identity design concepts and ideas, and had room to improve her attention to detail. She ended her internship with greater knowledge of exhibition design and visual communication, and her passion for visual culture and design had grown. She is now on the path to becoming a bright and confident communication designer.\nDiscipline: Environment and Interior Design\nStudent: Sato Yuri\nInternship Company: Hintegro Ltd., Hong Kong\nYuri’s learning objectives were 1) to develop her technical skills, 2) to improve the communication skills required in the work environment and 3) to understand what it is like to work in a design company and to learn what skills she lacked. A Japanese student, Yuri chose to intern in Hintegro because she was impressed with how the company integrated Japanese design into Hong Kong residential homes, and she wanted to learn about the company’s unique design process and to better understand client needs. During her internship, she got hands-on experience in various types of assignments, including image editing, drafting, site visits, interior styling, 3D modelling and presentations. Every week, Yuri jotted down descriptions of her week’s work for her internship report and reflected on her own performance.\nYuri participated in research projects and design proposals, working closely with her supervisors and fellow intern from School of Design. She initially struggled when she was tasked with a graphical collage and mood board, but with the help of her colleagues, she was able to learn new software skills and techniques, which will be hugely beneficial in her school assignments and design presentations. Yuri learned to keep an open mind on design approaches, to listen to others and to be open to new ways of thinking and communication.\nYuri’s workplace supervisor found that she had good interpersonal and communication skills, and was passionate about learning. Yuri seized every chance to explore new opportunities, such as interior styling and computer drafting. Upon completing her internship, Yuri developed other qualities essential to an emerging designer, such as teamwork, responsibility and believing in herself.\nDiscipline: Product Design\nStudent: TO Ka Wing, Jody\nInternship Company: The Coop Idea, Hong Kong\nFor Jody, joining the creative team that designed products she had been using since high school was a dream come true. When she first started her internship, she spent time recalling what she had learnt in the classroom, hoping to present the best version of herself to the company. Her learning objectives included how to fulfil tasks in a professional manner and how to receive constructive criticism from colleagues to improve the quality of her work.\nAs she prepared renderings for new and existing products, Jody realised that she needed to improve her software rendering skills to meet the demands of quantity and quality. She took the initiative to self-learn, studying online tutorials and executing those techniques on new tasks the next day. She also participated in design projects that were approved by clients to go into manufacturing stage, which she found extremely rewarding and exciting.\nJody wanted to improve her communication skills, and she seized opportunities to seek help from others and to interact more with her team, as she understood from experience that being proactive was an effective way to learn.\nDescribed as creative and professional by her team, Jody showed talent not only in product design but also in graphic design and photography. Reflecting on her internship experience, Jody felt that she had improved her multitasking skills and become a more reliable person. She greatly treasured her experience, as it helped her to improve her all-round skills and develop new abilities, which will surely be helpful in her career planning and future endeavours.",

During the 5-days visit, Grace had the privilege to immerse herself into a full-blown itinerary: touring around the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Seoul National University (SNU), and Yonsei University while interacting with fellow students on campus — an exclusive experience rarely given to undergraduate students. \n\"Each person I’ve had the opportunity to interact with only existed in photos and videos in my life until now. The PolyU senior management who I travelled with were real impact-makers who I had the chance to hold a conversation with!” \nGrace exclaimed as she reflected on the trip that felt, in some ways, surreal. She explains that the chance to have real dialogue with the senior management, picking each other's brains, exchanging insights on what it means to learn and achieve was the highlight of her trip. She was also delighted to share her voice as a designer in a science, engineering and technology-rich university, and how her discipline could be weaved into this strong academic network and contributions to bring about a more interdisciplinary outlook in learning more about the world around us.\nGrace sharing her PolyU Design experience with students at the Seoul International School.\n\"There were a lot of surprised looks since for most of the students, this was their first glimpse into university life in the city of Hong Kong.\"\nThe Communication Design student also had the chance to share her first-hand experience at PolyU Design when the delegation paid a class visit at the Seoul International School, amongst other engagements. From covering undergraduate application essentials to her everyday life on campus, all the way to flying out to the Parsons School of Design in the United States for a semester abroad, she gave the inside scoop to the school’s design class. All the memorable moments, both of delight and of hard work, were shared vividly and passionately for the prospective international students, encouraging them to paint their own vision of what a fast-paced and exciting student life in Hong Kong could look like. Snapshots of the iconic HK skyline view from Grace's dorm room, her personal studio space, the ample opportunities to complete exchange and 8-week internship abroad showed left them in awe.\nGrace enjoying the spring bloom at the Seoul National University.\n\"I felt like a bridge (of cultures).” \nWhen being asked of the most notable insight Grace gained from the trip, she responded by sharing with her new sense of belonging and identity. \"I have always been the 'other',\" she explained, \"as a third-culture kid in Hong Kong.” She goes on to explain that her background as a Korean growing up in Malaysia (albeit in an international bubble) has excluded her from being fully immersed in all three cultural contexts. However, this trip helped her realise that instead of desiring to belong in one fully, she can be a three-way bridge figure—keen to introduce the HK culture and lifestyle to the Korean communities while ensuring her fellow HK delegates felt at home was certainly bizarre yet fulfilling experience.",

With different levels of autonomous driving coming in years, MS would affect even more people. In this research, few predictors like sleep duration, exercise frequency and intensity, blood oxygen level and menstrual cycle timing are identified for susceptibility prediction. With current wearable technologies, these predictors can be monitored and tracked. The hypothesis is that it is possible to use wearable systems to predict susceptibility. User tests are performed to test an algorithm that is made up of the found predictors. The result shows positive correlations but not significant enough. Possible improvement ideas are then listed for further improvement in the prediction.\nTutor: Prof. Stephen J. Wang",

The owner could decide their zzity's character, had it maintained or changed every day. Is it a resort, a country, or a planet in outer space? The owner will make their choice!\nTutor: Chan Kam Fai",

Today’s throwaway society over-uses packaging, which damages the environment, and consumers expect everything on demand.\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, Pizza Express challenged students in this nine-week Cooperative Project to use excellence in design innovation to reduce its impact on the environment and to educate customers. This multidisciplinary project involved 17 students from Advertising Design, Communication Design, Environment & Interior Design, and Product Design.\nTwo teams of students examined existing packaging and disposable materials and then created new food packaging designs, focusing on the takeaway pizza box and takeaway utensils.\nTeam DoughCan researched takeaway habits and dining experiences and suggested two design campaigns. “From Nothing to Living” aims to create “life” out of waste by transforming used pizza boxes into planters or seed pads and by introducing a new environmental experience inside the Pizza Express restaurant with recycling stations and planting workshops. The “Most Valuable Pizza” campaign turns used pizza boxes into creative furniture, adding value to the takeaway box besides the pizza itself; the campaign also includes a cardboard restaurant that consists of a playful fit-out using cardboard tubes. Additional designs include a spiral-lock pizza box, an educational kids’ menu and social platform strategies for environmental days. \nTeam Margherita looked into current environmental issues in Hong Kong such as landfills and paper recycling. Students developed the design concept of a Pizza Festival, aiming to provide fresh pizza throughout Hong Kong while raising environmental awareness by promoting reusable utensils. The team also created a campaign and long-term system, 4R Cycle (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse and Reward), which was based on the core value of Pizza Express’ green code.

FoE hoped to educate the public on the perils of plastics and encourage 1% of the Hong Kong population to join the BYOB3 initiative by 2019.\nTo realise the FoE’s aims, students came up with deliverables such as a campaign strategy (promotional campaign and events), a campaign identity (visual identity, applications and a design manual) and associated products.\nThe campaign name, ‘Plasolution’, conveyed the twin goals of eliminating plastic usage and promoting a simple lifestyle. The proposed campaign had four stages: raising awareness, product launch, product promotion and consumer retention. The team came up with a minimalist design comprising the three curved lines of the Chinese character for ‘plastic’, a ‘do not’ sign and a stylised image of a leaf. The logo was developed for display on three product items: a box, a bottle and a bag.\nThe box was an origami-folded sheet using food grade PP, which has an estimated life of 3-6 months depending on frequency of use. To avoid spillage, handles were designed to reinforce the structure and to help reduce the use of plastic bags when carrying takeaway food. The parts of the bottle were separable, and the divider gave customers greater flexibility in usage.\nThe multifunctional bag was simple and elegant, with an emphasis on organisation and cleaning. When fully unzipped, the bag could be used as a placemat during a meal; when laid flat, any dirt in the corners could be easily removed and the inner layer of the bag quickly dried.\nParticipating students include —\nAdvertising Design Year 4 students\nCHENG Siu Hin, CHEUNG Tin Wai, NG Yat Yin and NGAI Man Yan\nCommunication Design Year 4 students\nCHAN Hau Lin, CHAU Tsz Wai, CHENG Cheuk Min and CHUNG Ka Yin\nProduct Design Year 4 students\nCHAN Wing Yiu, HUI Yat Ching, HUNG Yuen Ching and YAU Ka Lai\nProject Tutors —\nFUNG Ho Yin, Visiting Lecturer\nSchool of Design, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nWork-integrated Education in PolyU brings students together with real-world clients both inside and outside the classroom.

To attract a different target market to visit and use the centre, EPD collaborated with students to promote and design the centre, develop innovative product prototypes by upcycling yard waste and create an attractive, interactive and vibrant promotional campaign to foster sustainable behaviour in Hong Kong and showcase the innovative facilities. Taking into account the synergy to promote both yard waste upcycling and recycling, the centre finally forms the Resources Centre of Y‧PARK at Tsang Tsui, Tuen Mun.\nPrior to proposing design concepts and developing promotional campaign ideas for Y‧PARK, the student team carried out substantial research on the topic, including the wood waste problem, wood recycling difficulties and types of yard waste, and examined case studies of global wood-making workshops with specific furniture and space requirements. The student team also paid visits to the site and surrounding area in Fanling to better understand the context, background and circulation.\nAdvertising students then created a branding strategy proposal for Y‧PARK, which included designing and producing a logo, key visuals, MTR ads and a promotional video for the target audience. See the video here.\nEnvironment & Interior Design students developed zoning, circulation and lighting plans, proposed material choices and designed an interactive wall for the centre. The finalised spatial design concept for Y‧PARK was centralised yet open, interactive and communicative, including functional working and machinery areas, displays and free discussion zones in a flexible setting, as well as storage, a conference area and a play zone.\nProduct Design students worked hard to design and prototype modular furniture for the space based on different user behaviours, carefully considering ergonomics, flexibility, visuals and ways to enhance the productivity of yard waste in the process. An animation of the modular furniture joinery system is shown here.\nThe branding strategy, promotional video, spatial designs and modular furniture designs were licensed to EPD in 2021.

  "text": "Inspiring Change in Water Consumption Habits \nFounded in 2013, Water for Free is a non-profit Hong Kong based organisation that aims to reduce plastic waste and challenge existing approaches to recycling. In recent years, Water for Free has installed 70 water dispensers in schools to provide free water and stop people from buying single-use water bottles. \nAlthough the Water for Free app covers over 1,500 water dispenser locations, the organisation realises that this is still insufficient to serve the more than 7 million people in Hong Kong. Thus, students were commissioned to develop design and campaign strategies to promote changes in consumption habits and start a movement towards developing a society that has less impact on landfills and marine life.\nOver nine weeks, the student team conducted research on the consumption behaviour and drinking habits of Hong Kong people and their understanding of the plastic waste problem in the region. The team identified a number of advertising opportunities and developed several design campaigns based on their insights.\nAn important finding from the students’ research interviews was that people tend to forget to bring their refillable bottles, and hence make less use of the water dispensers. In light of this, the students devised an advertising strategy called ‘Essential 4’ to remind people to take essential items, such as their phone, wallet, keys and water bottle, when they leave home. The students designed four cartoon characters with unique personalities, appearances and storylines, which they then incorporated into animations, social media posts and app stickers. The advertising strategy aims to motivate the target users to cultivate a habit of carrying refillable water bottles in their daily lives, and hence to reduce the need to purchase bottled water.\nOther design and awareness campaigns include new signage designs for the water dispenser locations, updates to Water for Free’s mobile app, a bottle bag upcycling workshop, exhibitions on plastic waste and a logo rebrand for Water for Free.\nThe rebranded logo and several other design applications were licensed to Water for Free in 2020.\nParticipating students include —\nAdvertising Design Year 4 students\nCHEUNG King Ting, CHIU Yuen Sim, DE COSTER Lola Nicole M, \nFREITAS FERNANDES Luana Valeria, TANG Hoi Ling, YIU Yee Tung and YU On Lam\nCommunication Design Year 4 students\nAGARWAL Anoushka, CHAN Yin Lam, MOK Ka Ki and YAN Jing Tian\nEnvironment & Interior Design Year 4 students\nCHAN Hiu Ching, CHOU Yu-hsuan and CHUNG Man Yu\nSocial Design Year 4 students\nLEE Kin Wai Ken and LI Sin Yan\nProject Tutors —\nStefan SONNTAG\nSchool of Design, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nWork-integrated Education in PolyU brings students together with real-world clients both inside and outside the classroom.

The village faces social issues relating to aging, depopulation, isolation, a lack of government support and declining local industries. Roots Inc., an organisation that specialises in and promotes sustainable tourism, collaborated with students on this project with the aim of promoting the preservation of local culture, while creating a sustainable environment for Soni. The design tasks included redesigning the tourism centre, promoting the local village life and introducing Soni’s rich history, culture and traditional crafts to both international and local tourists.\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the local culture, the student team first embarked on a research and study trip to Soni, where they visited the Soni highlands and some local workshops. This provided the students with an opportunity to visit various sites, conduct interviews with the local villagers and industry practitioners and carry out first-hand observations. After observing the social issues in Soni, the students proposed a ‘4CO’ direction, comprising connection, cohesion, communication and co-creation, to enhance public engagement and create a more cohesive community.\nThe students developed three holistic Soni travel packages for different travellers and visitors. The travel package campaigns included logo designs, advertising strategies in Japanese and English, a user interface for mobile applications, different workshops and farming experiences, camping adventures, hiking and meditation routes, souvenir designs and detailed tour map designs. A working holiday programme was also introduced, with the aim of attracting international visitors to Soni and creating a more diverse culture by attracting young and energetic participants and creating potential job opportunities. The programme also aimed to boost the local economy and mitigate social issues such as depopulation and a lack of international tourists.\nThe students also designed local products and developed branding proposals based on the travel packages, which included a local character, an incense box, a camping and cycling lamp, and sake and bread packaging.\nLastly, the students re-designed the Soni Information Centre, providing accommodation, office, dining and common areas, bicycle parking, and exhibition and workshop spaces.\nCHOW Pui Yu and MOK Sze Kwan\nEnvironment and Interior Design Year 4 students\nCHOI Ka Man, LAM Ka Siu, LEUNG Cheuk Sum, \nSHIU Shuk Man, WONG Nap San Kelvin, YAO Xiaoqian, \nYEUNG Chi Hang, YEUNG Choi Kiu and YUEN Ying Ching\nLAI Hiu Cheung and MAK Ming Huen\nSocial Design Year 4 students\nCHAN Wing Kei Eunice and YEUNG Wing Tung\nMichael CHAN",

Intergenerational Play Space is a user-centric design that enables users of all ages to play and interact with one another, increases the public’s utilisation and enjoyment of public space and encourages ‘creative play’.\nThe Jockey Club Design Institute for Social Innovation tasked students to propose creative but feasible ideas to improve the Kowloon Park Fitness Trail, with a focus on intergenerational play space solutions. The challenge was to understand the community’s needs and then design integrated equipment and a trail experience for users of different ages using multi-purpose, age-neutral designs that encourage creative play, intergenerational interaction and more efficient use of space.\nBased on first and second hand research, including site visits, spatial and equipment analyses, user observations and interviews, the students learned about playground safety regulations and identified some problems with the existing facilities in the Kowloon Park Fitness Trail. The students sought to redesign the wayfinding system and provide better maps along the trail, update the Fitness Trail with new facilities and equipment based on the users’ needs and develop new workout exercises and programmes suited to the new equipment.\nThe students developed a new colour scheme and key visual elements in Memphis style, accented with bright colours and geometric shapes. The colours and patterns aimed to generate a distinctive, creative, modern and functional impression. A new wayfinding system and new facility/equipment instruction boards were also designed.\nThe fitness trail was redesigned into three areas – a play area, fitness area and leisure area. The play area aims to promote intergenerational and inclusive play on the fitness trail, with better access for wheelchair users. The students studied the existing interaction flow and user movements in relation to the existing equipment, and used tubes and nets to create play elements that resembled the existing play situation.\nOther facilities include a monkey bar, balancing beams, slide, climbing wall and multifunctional bars. The students created real-life scaled prototypes and mock-ups for some of the equipment and facility designs for user testing and material exploration.\nCHAU Hei Ching and LAM Lam\nEnvironment & Interior Design Year 4 students\nLEE Chung Pan, LEE Yuen Yi and WU Mingyue\nCHAN Wai Ho, CHEN Qixuan, CHINN Iris Kathleen, \nHUI Hang Tat and TSANG Yuen Yee\nSocial Design Year 4 students\nLUI Wing Yan and YIP Ying Kit Kitty\nTulio MAXIMO",

  "text": "Enhancing Visitors’ Experience at the LegCo Complex \nThe Legislative Council (LegCo) is the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Over the past one and a half centuries, LegCo has undergone great changes, evolving from an advisory body to a legislature with powers and functions to render checks and balances on the executive authorities.\nTo strengthen the public’s understanding of the work of LegCo, guided tours are arranged for the public to visit the LegCo Complex. Participants include students and teachers, members of the public, tourists and visitors/visiting dignitaries of LegCo. In addition to the various educational facilities installed along the tour route, a souvenir shop is set up in the Main Lobby of the LegCo Complex that offers for sale a selection of LegCo souvenirs and publications to enhance visitors' experience. The project is set to provide a memorable visiting experience through new visual communication concepts and an expansion of the current range of souvenirs.\nThe student team visited the LegCo Complex twice during their research phase, and conducted an in-depth research via interviews and observations to obtain objective evidence and insights leading to design aspects such as visual communication, a user-centred experience and ancillary products. The students identified three stages in the enhancement of the visitors' experience – promoting the guided tour with new visual aids; developing the LegCo’s visual identity and creating a better visitor experience on site; and designing new souvenir items that represent LegCo’s core values with the aim of creating a valuable sense of connection between LegCo and its visitors.\nThe students first worked on the LegCo’s brand identity, based on the core values of ‘openness’ and ‘public engagement’, by introducing new mood boards, font types and colour tones, and transforming the daily activities of LegCo into visual elements that can be incorporated into a poster, a website and other deliverables to promote the guided tour. The students then worked on a new online booking system for the guided tour to enhance the visual identity and accessibility by using the conceptual design elements of the LegCo Complex as a design feature. The students also redesigned the wayfinding and signage to the LegCo Complex with clear steps to guide visitors to undergo security screening and store their belongings in the locker area before entering the Complex. Other visual design elements include a visitor pass and a commemorative information booklet for tour participants.\nA few design concepts were also developed for souvenirs unique to LegCo to provide a more memorable experience for visitors. Students presented a few designs of souvenir items to the LegCo representatives, including a shoulder bag, a bookstand, a perpetual calendar and metal pins. Packaging designs and prototypes were also produced to complete the designs.\nSeveral design concepts are now under review for potential licensing to The Legislative Council Commission for design adoption.\nCHAN Yik Lam Elaine, LAU Siu Ying and TSE Tze Yung Ariel\nCHAN Ho Ying, CHEUNG Long Wai and LI Pik Hei\nCHAN Wing Sang, CHIU Wai Yi, LI Yi Wah, \nLIU Lok Yi, LIU Zeyu and TAM Yan Ying\nSocial Design Year 4 students\nCHEUK Hiu Yan and SUEN Wing Yin\nFUNG Ho Yin, Visiting Lecturer",

With the opening of the Permanent Activity Centre in 2019, the JPC commissioned students to work on rebranding schemes, multimedia publications and campaign proposals, social events promotions, campsite programme development, an exhibition design, and interior and landscape designs for the new campsite.\nOver the course of nine weeks, the student team worked on the design and execution of three events in preparation for the opening of the Permanent Activity Centre in 2019 – namely an obstacle course, a history wall exhibition and an art-jamming event; a rebranding design proposal for the JPC and the Centre in Pat Heung. \nStudents developed ‘PHRace’, an annual obstacle course race filled with assault-course infused challenges and open to participation by the public and organisations. The first annual PHRace will be held in 2019 when the Activity Centre opens, and will serve as a pioneer activity after the rebranding of the JPC. Besides the logo design and the overall theme of the PHRace, the students designed the contents of a racer pack, such as maps, postcards, T-shirts and towels; a gift bag and certificates, awards and medals; and the overall execution and obstacle stages of the PHRace.\nA history wall with infographics and interactive elements was proposed as part of the exhibition in the Activity Centre, to showcase the changes in the Police Force over the past 45 years and beyond. The students also proposed an art-jamming event and an installation on site at the Activity Centre’s open day, involving both the public and Police Force members to symbolise the bonding and building up of Hong Kong.\nThe design concept, design applications and obstacle course concept of the PHRace were licensed to the Junior Police Call Scheme as part of its Open Day activities in 2019.\nCHEUNG Hoi Yeung and LEE Hiu Wing Theresa\nCHAN Hin Yung and POON Ching Chloe\nCHAN Ka Cheong, CHEN Shuning, CHO Man Yiu, \nLAW Tsz Ho, LO Tsun, SHIU Wai Yi, \nYEUNG Sum Yi Sammy, YU Chun Lok and YU Pui Man\nLAM Tsz Ching and NG Cho Kiu\nMichael CHAN",

With a vision statement of “Art & Cake”, M Patisserie believes that each cake has its own meaning and story to tell, and hopes to share their clients’ special and memorable moments.M Patisserie currently has an ineffective ordering operation system – with lengthy customer messages and manual purchasing database entries; and unsustainable customer relationships. The project aim was to tackle these existing problems, enhance customer experience, and introduce new features for the bakery.\nStudents proposed a marketing strategy package that consists of reformation of the website, new built-in mobile app, and a feature wall in the physical store. The design strategy started with a vision statement of “Born to Be a Storyteller”, aiming to encourage interaction and enhance customers’ personal experience when ordering M Patisserie’s tailor-made designer cakes.\nThe new official website acts as a platform to collect customers’ stories and connect people under M Patisserie’s beliefs. Students also redesigned the cake ordering form in narrative interface with flipping-book animations. A physical card is also attached to the cake, which includes a photograph of the cake and handwritten notes, so customers can cherish the memory and story behind the occasion.\nThe feature wall in the physical store includes an interactive bookshelf and instant photo library, presented by two interactive monitors.

The case study informs us of two design insights- appreciating the creative use of vertical space and gap in the high-density living environment and maintaining quality life in chaos and order. “Sip-la” (placing objects into the gaps) is a practice of home stuff’s management commonly shared by Hong Kong households living under limited space. Endowing non-frequently used items a temporary identity brings visual and mental comfort yet not feasible in the long run. “THE POT: A SIP-ability Design for HK Household” explores the issues roused by space-sharing inside “home” from a human-centred perspective.\nWelcome to see the work and other amazing bamboo projects at the Exhibition. \nCIC-ZCP “Embracing the Bamboo” Outdoor Art Exhibition\nDate: 3 April to 30 June 2023\nAddress: CIC-Zero Carbon Park Grassland - 8 Sheung Yuet Road, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong\nFee: Free admission",

  "text": "Li Zihan, a Year-4 product design student, was selected as an awardee of PolyU’s Outstanding Student Award 2022 for his excellent academic performance at PolyU Design. After finishing high school in mainland China, he decided to begin his journey to become a designer in Hong Kong. We had a chat with Li Zihan to peek into a PolyU design student’s study life. Follow through our chat and see if PolyU Design is your next destination.\nQuestion 1. Why did you choose to study at PolyU Design?\nA: There are a few reasons. It starts with my background: A science student that always has a passion for art, I enjoyed drawing and making models since young. My interest in materialising ideas led me to choose the path of Product Design. My art portfolio built back then came in handy for the application of PolyU Design BA programme. \nThe high reputation and world ranking of the School were also the criteria I considered. Since I wanted to reach out to a more international and open platform, I decided to kick off my design journey in Hong Kong. PolyU Design has provided me with the global vision and exposure that I looked for in a design school.\nQuestion 2. List 3 things you find useful or inspiring about studying here\nRich learning resources\nA: From the well-equipped facilities to the experienced teaching staff, they make up a comprehensive and practical learning experience. Compared to my exchange college in Milan, PolyU Design has way better hardware, with studios, galleries and rooms fulfilling multi-purposes. For example, the Material Resource Centre has allowed me to learn about the characteristics of the materials and adopt them into my design. They have given me many inspirations through searching and touching the material samples. \nSTUDIO and fixed workspace\nA: Instead of moving around to different lecture rooms, we have our classes in a fixed classroom with our own working space. Studio is the place where we do almost everything, from taking classes and working on projects, to sleeping and having meals. It is a perfect place for us to engage with other students and exchange ideas.\nFrequent showcases and exhibitions\nA: Every few months or weeks, you can find new exhibitions at the podium galleries and other floors in the iconic Jockey Club Innovation Tower. This sets up an immersive design atmosphere. As I pass by the podium and corridors, I can always serendipitously find ideas from my peers’ works across different disciplines. It also feels like a significant recognition or encouragement to have your works showcased in exhibitions too.\nQuestion 3. Share one of your most unforgettable learning experiences in PolyU Design\nA: The most remarkable learning experience has to be the Co-operative Project and overseas internship. COOP Project was a great platform for practical experience. I worked on an interior design project in collaboration with Chinachem, the leading Hong Kong property developer. Having an actual client made the project realistic and rewarding. At the same time, it was exhausting with the heavy workload and big project group but the hard work paid off and I learnt a lot. \nOverseas Internship\nI took the chance to go on an overseas internship in Italy and worked at a furniture design studio, Sand & Birch Studio. Working overseas with professional furniture designers not only enriched my design skills but also broadened my horizons and nurtured my global vision.\nQuestion 4. What is your plan after graduation?\nA: I will carry on my journey in Milan, to study a Master’s degree in design there. At this stage, my focus is on exploring my interests, capabilities, and the trends and demands of society, to fit myself into the right field. I wish to be an adventurous designer. \nI am lucky that my parents are supportive of my dreams and decisions, they wanted me to do something that I like and enjoy life. I wish the same for myself. I would devolve myself into a career that I’m passionate about even if it may not pay a lot.",

  "text": "Grace Daeun Moon, a Year 3 Communication Design student from PolyU Design had the chance to accompany the university’s senior management in a visit to South Korea last month, taking up the role of the sole student ambassador. She sat down with us for a chat right after the trip, sharing the details of this eye-opening journey.\nThe delegation was led by university’s Council Chairman Dr Lam Tai-fai and joined by President Prof. Jin-Guang Teng and Vice President (Student and Global Affairs) Prof. Ben Young to strengthen the university’s global academic partnerships, taking collaborations to the next level. During the 5-days visit, Grace had the privilege to immerse herself into a full-blown itinerary: touring around the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Seoul National University (SNU), and Yonsei University while interacting with fellow students on campus — an exclusive experience rarely given to undergraduate students. \n\"Each person I’ve had the opportunity to interact with only existed in photos and videos in my life until now. The PolyU senior management who I travelled with were real impact-makers who I had the chance to hold a conversation with!” \nGrace exclaimed as she reflected on the trip that felt, in some ways, surreal. She explains that the chance to have real dialogue with the senior management, picking each other's brains, exchanging insights on what it means to learn and achieve was the highlight of her trip. She was also delighted to share her voice as a designer in a science, engineering and technology-rich university, and how her discipline could be weaved into this strong academic network and contributions to bring about a more interdisciplinary outlook in learning more about the world around us.\n\"There were a lot of surprised looks since for most of the students, this was their first glimpse into university life in the city of Hong Kong.\"\nThe Communication Design student also had the chance to share her first-hand experience at PolyU Design when the delegation paid a class visit at the Seoul International School, amongst other engagements. From covering undergraduate application essentials to her everyday life on campus, all the way to flying out to the Parsons School of Design in the United States for a semester abroad, she gave the inside scoop to the school’s design class. All the memorable moments, both of delight and of hard work, were shared vividly and passionately for the prospective international students, encouraging them to paint their own vision of what a fast-paced and exciting student life in Hong Kong could look like. Snapshots of the iconic HK skyline view from Grace's dorm room, her personal studio space, the ample opportunities to complete exchange and 8-week internship abroad showed left them in awe.\n\"I felt like a bridge (of cultures).” \nWhen being asked of the most notable insight Grace gained from the trip, she responded by sharing with her new sense of belonging and identity. \"I have always been the 'other',\" she explained, \"as a third-culture kid in Hong Kong.” She goes on to explain that her background as a Korean growing up in Malaysia (albeit in an international bubble) has excluded her from being fully immersed in all three cultural contexts. However, this trip helped her realise that instead of desiring to belong in one fully, she can be a three-way bridge figure—keen to introduce the HK culture and lifestyle to the Korean communities while ensuring her fellow HK delegates felt at home was certainly bizarre yet fulfilling experience.",

  "text": "Workshop on Human-Centred AI Design Methods to Understand “Intelligent Systems Design empowered by Multisensory Experiences with Textiles” has been successfully held in collaboration between our MDes Intelligent System Design (ISD) programme and the Royal College of Art, UK (RCA).\nCo-organising the workshop were Leader of the ISD programme and the Lab Studies subject (Intelligent Systems Construction), Prof. Stephen J. Wang, and RCA’s Textile MA tutor, Dr Elif Ozden Yenigun, and Research Associate Ms Lissy Hatfield. This workshop was to achieve the aims of co-generating tactile-based sensorial data for AI design tools and delivering the material centric design workshop to understand embodied ad tacit knowledge of the textile world. \nBenefiting from the unique nature of ISD “Lab Studies” subjects, the purpose of the workshop was to understand human sensory experiences of textile materials, allowing students to explore the relationships between physical properties and characteristics and the subjective assessment of materials through the evaluation of textiles based on a range of physical gestures and actions that human adopted. \nGuided by such experience, the ISD students brainstormed and developed ideas in groups around human-robot collaboration contributing to textile assessment at the end of the workshop.\nPolyU School of Design’s Intelligent Systems Design (MDes) programme highly recognises data and intelligence-related technologies as critical components in nowadays’ industry and society. To develop students’ future-shaping creative design vision using the intelligent system, the transdisciplinary workshop, as a part of the ISD’s “Lab Studies: Intelligent Systems Construction” subject, has provided students with an opportunity to be involved in real-world research projects.\nProf. Stephen J. Wang emphasised that “this workshop is well aligned with ISD’s vision ‘to educate a new type of designer, one that has an in-depth understanding of data and intelligent technologies, system-focused thinking, innovative design skills, and engineering or technology mastery’. We should especially thank AiDLab management team, Research Associate Mr Zhengtao Ma, RCA Textile Circularity Centre’s Dr Chipp Jansen, and PhD students of PolyU Design Ms Yaqi Zhang and Ms Cong Fang for their assistance in the workshop’s preparation and operation.”",

Do they serve to make us more inquisitive, better teachers, researchers, artists, performers, architects, or designers or does such study stultify the joy and wonder of the very subjects under investigation?\nThroughout higher education, while we may learn and know more stuff, hone our values, and develop a sense of the difference we wish to make, we seem to persist with teaching what we already know, and fail to articulate what we don’t know and hence what we may need to research and understand better together. To join up our thinking to that of others. How does the experience of the PhD assist us, or is it part of a more cynical global cycle of ‘qualification’ and ‘certification’ – doctoral title in search of a purpose? The percentage of faculty with PhD’s is frequently deployed as an indicator of the ‘quality and vibrancy of the research environment’, but is the contemporary PhD as it is currently practised, fit for purpose, and does it provide the skills, knowledge, and competencies we need to collaborate, contribute to the vibrancy of the academy or to the world beyond it?\nIn the true sense of a ‘school’ this is a provocation for an extended conversation.",

  "text": "The Master of Design (MDes) launched a revamped curriculum in 2022/23, offering four 1-year, full-time, studio-based professional degree programmes in design: Innovative Business Design, Intelligent Systems Design, Smart Service Design, and Transitional Environments Design. These programmes also offer part-time studies in 2023/24.\nThe new part-time mode of study combines the best of both worlds – it offers design education in its typical hands-on studio setting yet is available for working professionals.\nIn contrast to the conventional part-time, lecture-based studies where classes are held in the evening or at weekends, all MDes classes, offered in varying course types, are held during the day on weekdays. The MDes part-time mode of study may suit those with flexible work arrangements.\nThe option to pursue the studies part-time means students may complete the 36 credits required for graduation in a longer time frame of 3 years with fewer credits each semester. The study pattern in practice is that part-time students take 6 credits, or occasionally 9 credits, in Semesters 1 and 2 in their Year 1 and Year 2. Over the 13-week semester, they attend 2 – 3 class sessions per week. A class session is timetabled for 3 hours and usually commences at 9:30 am or 2:30 pm. In the final stage of the study, students focus on their Capstone Project or Industry Research Project.\nThe new mode of study responds to the new realities in the workplace. Many companies adopt hybrid work models, whereas the generation of younger professionals prefers a better work-life balance.\nBoth full-time and part-time local students admitted to any Master of Design programme (Stream Codes: 73035-IBD/IBP/ISD/ISP/SSD/SSP/TED/TEP) can apply for the Targeted Taught Postgraduate Programmes Fellowships Scheme (the Fellowships Scheme) offered by the University Grants Committee (UGC).\nRead more about the Fellowships Scheme on eProspectus.\nSubmit your online application via PolyU eAdmission.",

In order to enrich the animated content, it required them to conduct research in advance. \n“We hope to express the idea that words and knowledge in books carry the memories of different generations in our animation,” said Helen.\nAs for the making progress, Ceci added that the making of animation was not difficult, with a few layers of drawings. They visited the Central Library, storey by storey, to learn the features, to incorporate them into the works, enhancing the details of the animation. \nThe exhibition is held from 29th October to 20th November at the Exhibition Gallery in Hong Kong Central library, as a part of the Hong Kong Library Festival 2022.",

Designers have been involved in set design for all kinds of performance since the time of Palladio. \nSpace defines where we are, what we are looking at, what is above us, what is below us, what is behind us... but seldom is it really addresses at heart and to the soul, and that is emotion, the challenges is how to bring a poetic dimension through human life with different materials and how to create a space that is not just a repetition or nostalgia for the past but also opens new perspective that inspires the audiences with new thoughts.\nThis exhibition showcases the works from five interdisciplinary groups of the undergraduate students who took the stage and set design elective in the spring semester, 2023. The five groups selected totally different types of musicals and movies - from fantasy horror comedy to kids-friendly fantasy; from ancient time to modern city setting; one even picked science fiction - and re-invented one (or more) scene(s) to a new stage scenic and lighting design with a modern touch based on their own interpretation.\nCourse Tutor: Dr Joseph C.

  "text": "Year 3 – Critical Urban Topographies: the definition of the territory and the city, through its interiors\nCritical Urban Topographies, the theme for the 3rd year addresses aspects of complexity of the city and its processes of ‘interiorisation’. As framework, the studio operates on the premise that Hong Kong’s urban and territorial transformation occurs primarily through the interior. As design studio the focus is directed at urban extremes of harnessing spatial types, processes, actors and the possible lamination of these into a number of spatial types.\nWithin the 4-year curricula, the 3rd is seen as a critical junction between the 2nd year’s Cultural Hybrid Studio and the Open Studio of the 4th year. The 3rd year curricula focuses on foundational knowledge within the realms of architectural tectonics, services, spatial design and the supportive technologies within the first semester, with the second semester dedicated to critical research that allows for explorative and thematic driven design and deep investigation of associated spatial problems. \nSemester 1 focuses on aquiring basic technologies and design engineering skillsets. \nSemester 2 explores how design and technology merge as spatial propositions. \nYear 4 – Cooperative Studio\nCoop Studio is a semester one studio project working with real clients and multi-discipline teams on real projects. Students learn to understand client briefs, real issues and client needs and work with tutors and clients on the development of professional projects. \nThese are presented to clients and other stakeholders and can result in realised commissions by clients. Students also learn to work in a team and how to deal with project constraints as well as design stages of concept / ideation, schematic development, detail development and if necessary budgeting and specification. \nOpen Studio\nYear four is a year-long thesis based, explorative studio. Structured in three parts, in the fall semester, design research is used to identify and underpin critical and conceptual issues that are developed into final two stage design projects during the spring semester. \nYear four students explore critical issues which have meaning for their own trajectory as a designer, engaging all aspects of research and design praxis in the articulation of their individual approaches in appropriate scales, contexts, spatial registers and material manifestations. \nThe reflexive design processes engage discussion throughout development and through this process, individual students identify critical positions in their projects. Outcomes maybe speculative, pragmatic, detailed or narrative: 1:1, spatially innovative, experiential, or large scale, according to the constraints and possibilities determined by the individuals.\nSpecific focus studies including technical, material and detail studies give in depth investigations of individual projects.\nSubjects\nSenior year students are required to complete a total of 63 credits in order to graduate; including 9 credits earned from General University Requirements subjects, 12 from Common Compulsory Subjects, and 42 from Discipline-Specific and Elective Subjects.\nThe programme structures a range of discipline specific courses including history and technology, with courses from other disciplines from the School of Design and PolyU General University courses. As part of our discipline specific courses the programme offers a series of electives that provide learning choices for students.

  "text": "Study Streams\nMedia Design Psychology\nMedia Design Psychology is an interdisciplinary field that applies insights from psychology, aesthetics, art design, and communication theory to design. Design psychology studies and communicates relationships between producers, designers, and consumers in order to improve upon design processes. It examines the socio-cultural and physical environments that impact human psychology and behavior to help designers create and communicate more effective ideas. Students will learn through scientific, systematic research and be able to meet the demands of a global and diverse market.\nGame Media\nThis stream is aimed at developing the students’ capacity to conceive of professional games and communicate their design to developers. The basic principles of game design are taught as well as the ability to identify trends so that students can differentiate, discuss and synthesize their own ideas. Students will develop their knowledge for the gaming industry, while learning how to consider psychological, social, technological and cultural factors in creating fun and playable games. They will also learn how to integrate related game theories, while recognizing the evolution of the games industry and different genres of games, multiplayer games, and the basics of game engines and prototyping tools. Students will progress in this stream to learning about the processes of computer games with emphasis on a professional context. \nSocial, Mobile and Internet Media\nThis stream teaches entrepreneurial students the principles of social, mobile and web technology, and how to utilize these forms of media that is drastically changing the way we interact with the world and each other. As an increasingly influential area in academia and industry, students will be taught the fundamentals of utilizing web, mobile and social technologies. Topics that will be covered include design and creation of novel and practical concepts on mobile devices, social network, mobile search and browsing technology, and web-based applications with genuine product-market fit. For all three areas (mobile, social and web) students will be given the tools to create their own innovative applications for use and learn the means of development and distribution through these platforms. Students will learn to identify, manage and solve technical, organizational and design aspects related to the global digital media and web market. Students also learn how to find real world customers for their projects and are encouraged to commercialize their school project and look for external funding of their dreams.\nMedia Art Technology \nRecently, media art technology is developing rapidly, and it covers a wide range area. In general, art technology may be interpreted as applying multimedia technologies in creation of an artifact to enhance the content and delivery, support the succession of art and deepen audience experience. We challenge our students to combine the technical knowledge and skills with the artistry of design. Students will learn to explore, define, design, and apply artistic concepts into technologies, also using technologies as an artistic medium for applied design project.\nSubject Offering\nThe programme consists of 36 credits, involving 6 Compulsory Subjects, 6 Elective Subjects and a Master’s Project. Six core subjects lay an important foundation, and are required:\nSD5902 Production Processes in Multimedia and Entertainment (3 Credits)\nSD5953 Successful Project Management (2 Credits)\nSD5954 Innovative Multimedia Project Development I (1 Credit)\nSD5955 Innovative Multimedia Project Development II (1 Credit)\nSD5905 Recovering Creativity (2 Credits)\nSD5906 Globalization in New Media Design and Technology (3 Credits)\nProduction Processes in Multimedia and Entertainment, Innovative Multimedia Project Development, and Successful Project Management provide the practical foundation students will need to complete their Master’s Project and maximize their success in the marketplace.

  "text": "How Children Design: Observational Study of Children's Design Process\nLo Kwok Yin Angelina (2020)\nEducators and parents have met obstacles and challenges in nurturing creativity in children after almost two decades of education reform. The obstacles do not only lie in the discrepancy between education policy and practice but an overemphasis of product over process during which children create and design, in which the process refers to children’s understanding and identification of problems, ideation, materials exploration, and externalisation of ideas in the act of design and make. Through observing children's behaviour in such design process, this research depicts the typical characteristics of children design in an adult-non-directed condition. The study provides a deeper understanding of children’s design process that could be applied for future teaching strategies in children’s creative learning. Moreover, it opens up the potential for future observations and longitudinal studies of children’s design process in other socio-cultural contexts, and amongst the genders and age levels. Thesis Title Author's Name Year Details Enhancing the Travel Experiences of People with Visual Impairments through Application Design Huang Lusha 2020 View When current iOS applications or “apps” have met the basic requirements of visually impaired users, the discussion should be extended to address the higher-order needs such as self-esteem and self-actualisation. Beyond just focusing on the booking and navigation between different tourist sites, this study demonstrates how gamification assists in designing mobile applications that can enhance the tourism experiences of people with visual impairments. The study introduces a “research through design” project that incorporates app experiments, multisensory observations and interviews that are derived from sensory ethnography methodology. This research examines the perspective of applying gamification techniques to travel for people with visual impairments, which provides insights for government entities, social enterprises, and organisations which serve people with visual impairments. Ultimately, the results represent a further step towards developing advanced design research about people with visual impairments by proposing appropriate empathic insights and solutions regarding user experience design (UX), specifically in travel experience design. \nView",

  "text": "Adventurous Homemaking: Exploring Collaborations toward Agroecological Probabilities\nMarkus Wernli (2020)\nThis research investigates how attending to the basic needs of human bodily existence is mobilising transpersonal abilities toward integrative flourishing. Rearranging human-environment relations through the self-contracted crafting of daily life, requires courage, bodily engagement and failure tolerance. Through contemporising the co-regulating exchanges of fermentation, this study engages people’s bodyminds as biophysical agents in socio-natural ecologies which starts with their digestive byproducts—human ‘waste’, whereby human ‘waste’ becomes an integral element inside a self-contracted goal pursuit. This study evaluates self-mobilisation strategies and social buffering dynamics that assist people to commit to and prosper vis-à-vis adverse situations. A series of provocative human ‘waste’ upgrading events formulated a collective domesticity study where 22 participants participated in fermenting urine for growing edible plants and entering (biological) circulations of well-being. The dynamic tension of jointly encountered ambiguity together with the integrative goal created a failure-friendliness that was conducive to sociality, inventiveness, and rich emergence of meaning. \nView >>",

This research focuses on the application of participator design in community building, which regards participator design as a process of community self-organisation and development through community mobilisation and collective action. Particularly, the thesis examines the interrelationship between participatory design and community, and the adaption of participatory design within the community context of Mainland China. With regard to the concept of “community differential mode” suggested by the Chinese sociologist, Xiaotong, this study proposes specific design strategies and summarises three general principles [dynamic, transform and progressive] to enhance the applicability of participatory design in mainland China. \nView >>",

Particularly, this research investigates the deeper meanings of the Gao family patchworks from Yanchuan County, which demonstrates their relevance to new design technologies. Through a generative process in which the elements in patchworks are reused to generate 3D designs, this research examines how the transformation facilitates traditional art preservation and develops relative design skills using advanced design technologies. Several methods have been proposed for the coding of the generative product design system, in which variations of these 3D products could be made beyond the imagination of the original patchwork artists.\nView",

However, a study on the current development of the creative industries in mainland China suggests that most of the organisations in the creative sector fail to establish a conducive environment for creative performance. This research investigates the relationships between various motivators and the performance of creative workers in China's creative industries. By conducting interviews and online questionnaires with managers and creative workers in China's creative industries, the findings indicate that managers and the creative workers in China are similar. Still, the execution and management of these motivation strategies do not meet employee expectations. The results enrich the knowledge in motivating creative workers in China's creative industries, in which management and policymakers in China would gain insight into the management skills required to motivate creative employees. \nView",

This research explores how embodied thinking supports the development of new design methodologies that facilitate the experiences of actively participating audiences in interactions with ambient media. Based on the theories of embodied cognition and cognitive semantics, this research focuses on developing an embodied approach to analysing and designing ambient media through a series of studies. To understand audience experiences with ambient media and develop an approach to embodied interaction design, an in-depth discussion clarifies and synthesises the findings from three studies, whereby the implications are summarised with a view to informing further research and design practice.

  "text": "Fostering Sustainable Behaviour through Social Games: Elements of ‘Gamified Behaviour-Change Programmes’ Contributing to the Process of Behaviour Change for Environmental Benefit\nSharma Satyakam (2019)\nThe significance of behavioural change has inspired designers to make strategic use of design to induce a positive change in behaviour regarding the usage of products and resources to reduce environmental impacts. Diverse approaches have emerged which encourage sustainable behaviour in the form of social innovations. Gamified behaviour-change programmes (GBCPs) are one example. This research investigates the mechanics of GBCPs, particularly the process through which they prepare, motivate, transform and incubate behaviour under the influence of a social setting and using a game-based approach. Utilising the findings from an empirical study of GBCPs, the study investigates the factors and conditions that influence the central phenomenon of behaviour change and identifies 41 elements that directly or indirectly contribute to the process of behaviour change. This thesis provides insights into the mechanics of GBCPs and raises the importance for designers, creative idealists and social entrepreneurs to consider GBCPs as an approach when addressing sustainability objectives.",

That is, what does spatial computing bring to the table. For once, the spatialization of our senses. We can enhance audio or proprioception in complete new ways. We can grab and touch objects with new controllers, like never before. Even in then empty space between our hands. But how fast do we adapt to the new sensory experiences?\nAvatars are also unique to VR. They represent other humans but can also substitute our own bodies. And we perceive our world through our bodies. Hence avatars also change our perception of our surroundings.

  "text": "Speaker\nPeter-Paul Verbeek\nThe impact of new and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, genome editing, and climate engineering, is so profound, that it can be considered to be disruptive. These technologies do not only have radical consequences for society — as is expressed by the concept of 'the Fourth Revolution' and 'Society 5.0' that is emerging from that — but also for critical and ethical reflection. Technologies have become ethically disruptive, in the sense that they challenge and affect the very concepts with which we can do ethics in the first place. What do 'agency', 'responsibility' and 'empathy' mean when artificial agents are entering society? What does 'democratic representation' mean when climate engineering might urge us to also include future generations, and the rights of ecosystems? What can the notion of 'the humane' still mean when genome editing enables us to develop human-animal hybrids? This seminar will explore the ethically disruptive character of emerging technologies in detail, by investigating the various ways in which technologies can be ethically significant themselves. Breaking the human monopoly on ethics and expanding it towards technology will make it possible to connect ethics more directly to practices of design. The resulting 'Guidance Ethics Approach' enables bottom-up ethical reflection that can foster the responsible design, implementation and use of new and emerging technologies.\nJoin this seminar on Zoom\nURL: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/82730229596\nMeeting ID: 827 3022 9596\nPasscode: 497630\nAll PolyU PhD students are welcome.\nThis seminar, hosted on Zoom Meeting, allows only authenticated users (i.e. Zoom logged-in users).\nEvent registration is required (click HERE).

  "text": "The screenshot is the workhorse of contemporary digital culture. Utterly ubiquitous as a method of quoting from digital media, usually within digital media, the screenshot continually escapes our attention as the focus and product of cultural practices. In this talk I will argue that the screenshot is not only among the most commonplace and overlooked of digital objects, but that it confounds prevalent theories of digital media — and digital images — as performances in perpetual flux and as ‘softimages’. Investigating the screenshot as a vehicle of communicative fixity, I will analyze it as a remediated photograph and a mode of witnessing, delineating the epistemological and ontological assumptions that accompany its ubiquity. I will then examine the screenshot as a digital spectacle, and foreground how it implicates its displayed reference worlds (such as social media interfaces and game scenarios) as spectacular and contingent. Just as the photograph implies the plenitude and mutability of physical existence beyond the image of the scene it depicts, so the screenshot implies the plenitude and mutability of a digital lifeworld beyond the image of the screen it preserves.\nURL: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83429104665?pwd=b3FuZ2lQU2xKSUhVK1ZXNlR5OUJwdz09\nMeeting ID: 834 2910 4665\nPasscode: 380510\nPaul Frosh\nProfessor, Department of Communication and Journalism, Hebrew University of Jerusalem\nPaul Frosh is a Professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

  "text": "In this PhD seminar, we will engage with the concept of ‘worlding’, understood as the processes through which a world is created, and discuss the role of design in the construction of our lived environments (milieu). We will first introduce and briefly discuss three different angles through which this concept has been approached: phenomenology, post/colonialism and new materialism, respectively, looking at the agential force and practical modes implicit in each one of them. We will then focus on the neo-materialist perspective specifically as a framework to speculate how design – as a transversal, mediating agent – may become a powerful tool in the creation of multiple worlds and better futures.\nThe two-hour PhD seminar will be structured in two parts according to the thematic content, to guarantee a dynamic flow of ideas and participation. The first part will consist of a half-hour lecture on the three understandings of the concept of ‘worlding’, followed by a half-hour discussion among the participants who are asked to identify, relate and articulate their doctoral research within one, or several of the presented frameworks. The second part will consist of a half-hour lecture focusing on how new materialism, process ontologies and a philosophy of ‘affirmative becoming’ may be made operational in theory formation and design research. Participants are encouraged to discuss their own work, raise problems, doubts and questions, and engage each other within the frameworks introduced in the seminar. The aim of the seminar is to introduce participants to basic notions of new materialist philosophies and their relevance for design practice and the spatial disciplines, while fostering a safe space for the exchange of ideas and speculative thought.\nThis seminar was previously scheduled to be held on 24 Nov 2021.

  "text": "Things are not what they used to be. Many of the things of everyday life are now connected, responsive, and constantly changing. They are more like fluid assemblages (Redström and Wiltse 2019) than stable objects. These kinds of things often relate to us as we relate to them, perhaps even using us in order to provide value for other actors and user positions in the larger systems of which they are part. Indeed, one of the key functions of connected things has become producing data about everyday life that can be used by corporate platform owners to predict, nudge and control. The general economic model that has been characterized as surveillance capitalism (Zuboff 2019), platform capitalism (Srnicek 2017), and data colonialism (Couldry and Mejias 2019) strongly shapes the designed functionality of things that seem to constantly be getting closer, more embedded, more pervasive, and more essential, as well as more worrying when, for example, reading privacy (or surveillance) policies or being mindful of the strong pull they often exert on our attention and behavior.\nIn this talk, Dr Heather Wiltse will expand on the conceptual framework of fluid assemblages and how it might be used to come to grips with what contemporary connected things are and do. In particular, Dr Wiltse will focus on the role of fluid assemblages in mediating platformed relations. She will conclude with reflections on the kind of critical design practice and competence that is needed for responsible design of connected things and systems, and how the possibilities of technological innovation might be redirected toward more hopeful alternatives. \nHeather Wiltse (PhD) is currently associate professor in design for the data-intensive society at Umeå Institute of Design, Umeå University (Sweden). Her transdisciplinary research centers around trying to understand, articulate, and critique the role of digitally connected, responsive, and data-intensive things in experience and society in ways that can inform response-able design. Building on a background in human-computer interaction, science and technology studies, design, and communication and culture, Dr Wiltse's research focus is currently on doing design philosophy at the intersection of design theory and philosophy of technology. Her recent books are Changing Things: The Future of Objects in a Digital World (with Johan Redström, Bloomsbury 2019); and (as editor) Relating to Things: Design, Technology and the Artificial (Bloomsbury, 2020).

Paradigms are sustained by beliefs and assumptions, therefore part of the task is to find the words that will make the next paradigm thinkable. At this high level of complexity, actions must also be co-creative, therefore we cannot expect design to be as predictive as traditional design. However, if we focus on relationships, rather than ‘things’ we can cultivate synergies at all levels, including the vital operational synergies within Metadesign teams. This means that teams must coordinate themselves as heterogeneous and flat-structured entities.\nURL: https://zoom.us/j/98940127809\nMeeting ID: 989 4012 7809\nPasscode: 876853",

  "text": "What would you think of organic fertilizers? Living compost? Animal feces? Stinky and disgusting? Have you ever heard about a clean, good-smelling fertilizer for farming made from the uneaten leftovers on your plates?\nA group of social design and communication design students joined hands for an eco-farming project—Soil Trust, that experiments with community food waste collection to be made into Bokashi compost. This is not only aimed towards an eco-friendly lifestyle, but also highlights the importance of local farming for reintegrating organic resources and for providing eco-system services. \nBokashi is an age-old resource recovery method made popular in Japan since the 80s, that turns food waste into soil amendment by means of fermentation. During the fermentation process, it releases a fruity and malty scent of wine, instead of a rotten smell. \nThe Soil Trust team established its base on organic farmland in Tai Kong Po, Yuen Long. There, they process the collected food waste into soil-regenerative eco-enzymes and bokashi compost. The enzymes and compost undergo months of fermentation and care before they can be applied to the fields: \nYes, it requires more work than conventional farming practices. That’s why bokashi is not widely adopted in Hong Kong,” said Shing, the Soil Trust farm manager. \nDespite the extra work and processing time required, bokashi can not only help to cope with food waste from various sources but also has great potential for bringing crucial microbial life back into the soils of small-scale plantations in a self-sufficient way. \n“We hope to bring farming into urban households so that people can produce their food and learn more about and appreciate the food they consume every day,” said Kit Tsang, one of the student team members.\n“Hong Kong is over-reliant on extremely long food supply chains, which depend on imports from mainland China and around the globe,” said Annie Lee, a team member. “If we could build a self-sufficient way of food cultivation, especially for fresh fruits and vegetables, the price and supply of food would be more stable—more independent of external factors. This way the city would have higher resilience to uncontrollable situations like the COVID pandemic and bad weather.”\nThe farm is yielding a variety of crops, such as corn, sweet potatoes, strawberries, lettuce, broccoli, and more. Before becoming food, the crops are nurtured by food. This cycle of food production sets an example for the regeneration of resources. \nIn the coming months, the team is expected to make use of the materials and experience acquired to create a design intervention to tighten the connection between food waste collection, bokashi-based farming, and the promotion of an eco-friendly lifestyle in their Integrated Entrepreneurship Project.",

  "text": "The following are the original remarks by Henry Steiner, Honourary Professor and Founder of Steiner&Co., who was unable to attend the ceremony as Congregation Speaker due to sickness:\nIn college I was initially undecided between majoring in Visual Art or Literature and decided that it was much easier for me to draw one picture than to write a thousand words. So I chose the Visual Art Stream.\nAt Hunter College in those days some of the star artists of the New York School of Abstract Expressionism were our teachers. But except for one class in printmaking and for reasons not understood at the time, I felt uncomfortable with painting.\nIn my senior year, the printmaking teacher was assigned to discuss post-graduation work with me. We agreed that I had absolutely no future as a painter so he asked me what I had really enjoyed doing at college.\nI told him it was the extra-mural activities, like art editing the college newspaper, the literary magazine and yearbook, creating posters, and stage designs for school plays, etc. My mentor said: “You know, I also teach printmaking at Yale in a new department of the Art School. Why don’t you come and study Graphic Design?”\nI replied: “Sure. What is that?”\nYou see, at the time the only term I recognized was “commercial art”. \nWhat had been a craft, albeit one that traced its lineage back to Gutenberg and even further back to the inscriptions on Trajan’s column in the Roman Forum, was by the 1950s, morphing into a sort of profession.\nBut, is graphic design a profession? I’d like to explore this question with you.\nTo me, a real profession is one where you need to have a license, or other formal recognition, because malpractice could have serious consequences. It is said that while a doctor’s mistakes are buried, those of a lawyer are left hanging from the gallows for all to see.\nIncompetent graphic design may keep the shredder busy, or get you lost in a strange city, or result in a migraine headache.\nIncidentally, there is some confusion about the distinction between design as art or craft which was defined by a colleague as follows: “A designer tries to solve his client’s problems. A painter tries to solve his own problems.”\nYes, we’re designers, not artists. Like most of us, I prefer to receive assignments, not to create them. This explains my discomfort with painting, mentioned earlier. I have no message to inflict on the world, but I love to solve communication problems for my clients.\nI should point out that this idea of Art (with a capital A) as something elevated which is dreamed up by inspired individuals following their passion, has only been around for the last 200 years or so. Before that, artists worked to order. They were hired to do portraits, landscapes, murals. Like a taxi, they don’t start moving before the meter goes down.\nThe big shift in design in the 50s was away from a consistent, painterly “style”. Designers formed in that period prided themselves on not being recognizable, in not repeating themselves. Their satisfaction came from analyzing a client’s specific communication problem and coming up with a solution not resembling anything they’d created before.\nCan you picture a doctor who prescribes two aspirins a day to every patient she sees no matter what the complaint is ? Get the analogy with a designer who pushes some variant of the same style on every client.\nThe joy of design, for me, is in new challenges, in the surprises. Ideally the design solution reflects the client’s personality not mine.\nThe designer/client relationship is a symbiotic one, and there are two ways of visualizing it. One is to compare it with the structure of our brain. I’m sure you know about the functions of the left and the right hemispheres. The left in computer language is a serial processor while the right is a parallel one. Or put more simply, the left is numbers while the right is music.\nAnother image is that of the Tai Chi symbol, the central visual element in Taoism.\nIt stands for light/dark, hot/cold, male/female, plus/minus. Contrast gives life to a design. \nOnce you grasp this fact you realize the supreme importance of communications between the two.\nOur clients tend not to be thrilled by shapes and colors. They’re concerned with the bottom line. We must express to a client the reasoning behind a design solution in the form of a story which gives the idea underlying the proposal. Sometimes - and this should be our little secret – we might make up the story after creating the design. Now, this is not actually dishonest. Most creatives find out their true purpose after the fact. I’m sure you’ve had hints of how your subconscious can be working away even when you’re not. As form must follow function.\nThere is another little secret. Most of our best ideas…. come from the client. There should be no shame or guilt attached to this revelation.\nLike a management consultant - or a psychoanalyst - we should probe deeply and listen attentively to our clients. Our recommendation then comes from an insightful approach to their individual problems. It is from delving sensitively into our client’s story that we can uncover the idiosyncratic, the quirky, the fresh ideas they themselves didn’t appreciate before.\nI’d like to think design is a profession. My father was a dentist, my mother a seamstress, a sample maker on Manhattan’s Seventh Avenue. You could say it’s in my DNA. And design’s been good to me.\nStill, as a profession, design is a modest one; useful but not terribly prestigious. Somewhere between an architect and a tailor.\nBut, as designers, we are here to make ordinary objects extraordinary – pleasant, useful, witty, and sometimes inspiring. Using our powers of observation and working with economy and improvisation, we battle the enemies: mediocrity, cynicism, neglect.\nWhat matters is to send, through our craft, modest messages which others will receive saying: “Somebody cared about this.” \nCongratulations and warmest wishes in your design profession.\nMore speeches at the 28th Congregation:\nWelcoming Address by Prof. Kun-Pyo Lee, Dean of School of Design and Swire Chair Professor of Design, Alex Wong Siu Wah Gigi Wong Fook Chi Professor in Product Design Engineering\nValedictory Speech by Miss VONG Ka Hei - PM Session\nValedictory Speech by Miss CHOW Hiu Yim Ceci - AM Session",

Yet, it is this intrinsic nature that makes it challenging to articulate and acquire in design education. Spatial understanding as a component of tacit knowledge in interior design is an area that is not fully investigated. This explorative research aims to study interior design students’ process of tacit knowledge acquisition in the context of the interior design studio. Constructivist theories are applied to obtain a holistic understanding of tacit knowledge construction through three perspectives of teaching, learning and studio interactions. The position of design as a dialogue and Donald Schön’s Reflective Practice theory serves as a basis for the inquiry.\nResearch Methodology and Results/ Outcomes\nThe Environment and Interior Design (BA) programme of the School of Design, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University was chosen as a case study for the interpretive research. Eight students and respective tutors across the studios from all the years were extensively observed and interviewed for two years. Supporting data collection methods included focus group interviews, experience sampling and document & material analyses. Data were collected in four stages with concurrent data analyses at each stage.\nThe study has generated a working definition and criteria for tacit knowledge construction. Insights and outcomes from the study contribute towards suggesting a framework and recommendations for the facilitation of tacit knowledge construction in the studio.\nKey publications\nVenkatesh, A. and Ma, Henry.

Following the book Design Commons (Springer, 2022), the panel will debate on material conditions and their transformations in four areas of design: social, cultural, ecological, and transdisciplinary practices. The range of perspectives is meant to reflect on the various critiques to engage with the commons as both concepts and modes of thinking, and their material translation when contextualized in the domain of design questions, moving abstract social science concepts toward material application and other tangential questions.\nThree members of PolyU Design will join the session.

It explores the inter-related components of neon signs, including each sign’s unique visual aesthetic and design, the history of craftsmanship and training, and how the streetscape relates to Hong Kong’s consumer culture.

The Fund offered the production team HKD 5000 scholarship and the POC Bootcamp with Dedicated Team Coach. \nPOC Funding Scheme is one of the key entrepreneurship education components at PolyU aiming to instil a problem-driven innovation mindset into young talents through experiential learning and student-initiated research and development.\n“The Fund offered us financial support and encouragement as well as the opportunity to get advice from professionals, which has helped us to consolidate our idea for improvements and further development. We really appreciate having the opportunity to participate in the POC Fund,” said Rank B, the production team. \nIn May 2022, Codename: Apocalypse entered INDIE Live Expo 2022—a biannual live digital showcase connecting global indie fans with more than 57.5 million views—to broadcast a 15-second promotion video of the creation to international audiences on an online live stream. The event was broadcasted in 3 languages (English, Chinese, and Japanese), featuring a large number of Indie games. \nThe gameplay project was launched as a game demo on itch.io in August 2022, providing a short version of the full game to deliver the core ideas to players. Although the team has not had a concrete plan to launch the full game by far, they will continue the developing progress and explore possibilities to launch the game in full. \n“Game development will always be our passion despite the tough journey taken on,” said the team. \nApart from being a POC awardee, the project is also a semi-finalist of PolyU Micro Fund and is shortlisted at Cyberport Creative Micro Fund – Hong Kong Young Entrepreneur Programme. \n(*MscMET offers four constantly adapting streams: Game Media; Media Design Psychology; Social, Mobile and Internet Media; and Media Art Technology.)\nTeam members of Rank B: Ronald Wu, Anthony Sze, Nicole Ho, Kenis Lee, Borease He\nSupervisors: Chou Ka Seng, Lam Wai Man\nWatch the game’s full trailer here.",

These highly accomplished projects embody and encapsulate their learning experiences from the three distinct programs. Through this exhibition, we hope to create a platform for fostering conversation among students from different cultural backgrounds. \nAs the title ‘Knot’ suggests, the contemporary comic book-making world is not only expanding but also becoming increasingly interconnected. Despite so much diversity, preserving unique voices remains a priority. We believe that, during the course, interconnections are forged through remaining vulnerable to each other and the sensibleness of our choices. Therefore, the knots we choose to form reveal the future we hope to make. \nCollaborating schools:\nPolyU Design\nBA(Hons) in Digital Media offered by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University School of Design aims to produce idea driven content designers regardless of their disciplines. It rights the paradigm of confusing creativity based on ideas with fabrication based on technical know-how. With this in mind, students are also taught the necessary technical, entrepreneurial and analytical skills in order to become self-learning and self-enabling for the successful execution of a given creative idea. \nThe programme facilitates personal growth in students through self-discovery, self-discipline, self-analysis and self-learning. Encourage independent thinking, successful positioning and inventive creation through contextual awareness, imagination, collaboration and knowledge application. \nBaekseok Culture University\nThe Department of Webtoon and Animation at Baekseok Culture University seeks to cultivate creative talent in global cartoons and animations. \nThis department consists of the webtoon and animation departments, providing field-oriented and customised education based on primary education for cartoon animation. \nIn Korea, this department is one of the best educational institutions to foster webtoon artists and animators who can express their high creativity and technical skills in an advanced academic environment.\nShanghai Institute of Technology\nSchool of Art and Design of Shanghai Institute of Technology was founded in 1959, known formerly as Shanghai Light Industry College Fine Arts Department, and one of the earliest institutions to cultivate talents specializing in art and design in Shanghai and China. . There are two majors at present: painting and design. With a history of over 50 years, the major of Art and Design consists of seven specialties, including visual communication design, multimedia design, interior design, landscape design, industrial design, exhibition design, and decorative design ; and the major of painting consists of two specialties, namely painting and watercolor painting.",

Bravo!\nYour courage is indeed our pride. Behind you, strongly stand family and friends who have helped you along the way. We salute them too! Thank you for always being there.\nAs designers, we see the world changing around us every day, and at great speed too.\nDigital transformation is accelerating, and along with that, AI is rapidly replacing designer’s unique skill sets. Your creativity is key.\nThese transformations need to be human-centred, and that is where designers can add value.\nI would like to emphasize the importance of data. You must become\ntech ‘athletes’ – target scientists, coders and engineers to help you tackle highly complex design problems.\nIndeed, students may have graduated in one area, but design is multi-disciplinary. You’ll not only be working within the bounds of your programme, but be working with other disciplines in an ever complex level of design.\nUsing an inter-disciplinary mindset, your designer’s creativity can be applied to non-design disciplines.\nIt’s the reason we are transforming both our education and research around these trends.\nChanges made to the Foundation Year and Master of Design curricula keep us at the forefront of design globally.\nFor Art and Design, we currently rank 16th out of 2500 institutions globally in the QS World University Rankings.\nOur belief is that excellent schools are built by communities. We look forward to a new era of Hong Kong dynamism fuelled by a community of ambitious, risk-taking talent from our School.\nRemember – We are not individuals, but rather, a collective. And that, my friends, is where you all come in.\nWhen you succeed, we also succeed, and vice-versa.\nYour studies may be ending, but the working life is just beginning.\nIt’s just as well, the world needs innovators and adventurers with an international mindset, more than ever.\nAs Poly U grads, you are among the best. Show your abilities, creativity, teamwork, professionalism and strong ethics.\nYour mission, if you choose to accept it, is to extend your knowledge and experience to global issues.\nDesign problems are both complicated and critical. Whether it is sustainability, ESG, inequality or ageing, we need to think less about ‘how’, but more about ‘why’.\nInequality is also a critical issue impacting the future of the planet; make one of your passions helping the underprivileged.\nThe world can be very different to what you now know, so keep an open mind and be curious, inclusive and critical.\nKeep that in mind as you progress, and remember to update us on your work, adventures and news, whether they are ‘successes’ or ‘failures’ – all your work is a platform for debate, development and progression.\nYou are explorers – the road will not always be smooth. Embrace uncertainty and believe in your abilities.\nWhatever happens, we never stand alone. You are invaluable to us – this will always be a place you can call home.\nYour alma mater will always be a vital source to meet people, increase your network, and learn about new industries.\nYou might even want to come back and join a lecture, or even give one to our students!\nThe best of luck, and may you be forever successful.\nGo out there and make us proud.\n(back to top)\nValedictory Speech by Miss VONG Ka Hei - PM Session\nGood afternoon and welcome honourable guests, School of Design, Dean Lee and the graduates of 2022.\nTo the graduates of 2022, congratulations and great job, we have graduated in the face of a two year pandemic.\nI would like to say “Thank you” to PolyU for giving me a degree and the privilege to deliver this speech for the congregation of 2022. I am grateful for the opportunity to reflect on my university days and I can’t help but recall a lot of fond memories.\nHaving said that, Year One was intense and confusing. With projects like “Body Extension” and “Narrative Framing”, I do remember our group model broke just one week before submission, and the sleepless nights spent installing our models at four am in Temple Street. Daniel and Henry were very honest about projects, perhaps too honest, that sometimes they neglected our feelings. Some of us cried, but I did really enjoy their way of teaching. In the end, they always gave us a list of questions for us to reflect and improve. Furthermore, when they gave compliments, it felt like winning an Oscar. Thank you, Daniel, and Henry, for your amazing teaching.\nI recall days where our models and drawings piled up the studio. We would work late at night with strong coffee and hyper music. I remember the day we were tired of the critiques and started playing “Thomas 小火車” in our models and Kuo stared at us with an disbelieving expression. We used to gather in circles after tutorials, discussing our projects and feedback. We exchange ideas, and beliefs, and sometimes debates, we explored everything together, and I cherish all these moments.\nThe greatest lesson I learnt in university is the true meaning of passion and productivity. When I chose to study design, I believed I should work very hard for it. For every studio project, I was working days and nights, seven days per week. I was so attached to the project that I detached from living. I forgot to ask how my parents and friends were doing, forgot to hang out with them, make time for them… Moreover, perfectionism stepped in, where I became more anxious that things were not going in the direction I expected. I was in a toxic cycle of labour.\nHowever, after all those experiences, I believe being passionate and productive does not mean to solely focus on one goal, but rather enhance the balance of life, and help us live to the fullest. As Cara Delevingne once said “When you have balance in your life, work becomes an entirely different experience. There is a passion that moves you to a whole new level of fulfilment and gratitude, and that’s when you can do your best for yourself and others”. Long walks at the beach, city or village should be encouraged, especially as a time to bond with family and as a moment to observe the surroundings.\nMy final year and during job interviews, people asked me: “What do you want to do in the future?”, “What kind of projects do you want to work on?”, or “What is your career plan?” … To whoever asked those questions, I do not know the answer. I don’t have an organised and calculated career plan. When it comes to decision making, I often hesitated and felt intimidated because I was afraid of making the “wrong choices”. Nevertheless, there are no right choices. In every decision, there are consequences and benefits, and remember that nothing lasts forever. Being in an ever changing environment with both external and inner pressure meant that we would feel defeated and lost at times. Therefore, I would like to encourage all of us to always remember why we started, stay true to your passion, and just keep trying.\nLet me take this opportunity to appreciate the hard work and education provided by faculty members and university authorities.\nThank you professors, for not only presenting us with knowledge, but also understanding.\nThank you to all the cleaning staff, for keeping our studios organised and our models secure.\nThank you parents, for your unconditional love, patience, and support during our studies.\nThank you, friends, for being the greatest source of encouragement and helping hands in times of need. I would like to acknowledge my university besties, Emily and Ellie, you guys are my greatest source of inspiration.\nOnce again, congratulations to the class of 2022.\n(back to top)\n<yt-formatted-string class=\"style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer\"></yt-formatted-string>\nValedictory Speech by Miss CHOW Hiu Yim Ceci - AM Session\nDear guests, teachers, fellow schoolmates and parents, welcome to the School of Design Congregation.\nMy name is Ceci and it is my honour to be the representative of the graduating class this year.\nThere have been plenty of memorable and remarkable moments in our time here. Having walked the same journey as my classmates. I would like to give the following notes of thanks on behalf of the graduating class:\nI would like to thank SD The School of Design, which has provided me with abundant opportunities to fulfil my potential. I have learned our role as designer and creator is not just problem-solving and providing elegant solutions. The impact of good design reach far into our culture and society.\nPaul Rand said:“Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.”\nSD has made the impossible possible. We learned to create everything from zero.\nDesigners are dreamers. We aspire to create our own projects, launch our own campaigns and make the world a better place. The School of Design is full of visionaries who expand our horizons.\nAs Digital Media Design (DM) students, we are passionate about watching animations, movies and reading stories. But today, I am grateful to share my own story with all of you.\nMany people ask me what a SD student being is all about.\nI would say studying at SD has trained me to be multi-skilled, we have learned to become storytellers as well as animators or film makers. We use different media to create our stories.\nThere is more than one way to create, and all skills are transferable.\nIn this fast-changing world, being familiar with different media gives us a competitive edge to be flexible. I always find it interesting that even if we have different ambitions, we can still study together and learn from each other, no matter which path we ultimately take.\nThis is a crucial skill that will help us throughout our careers.\nI have loved drawing since I was small, but I never thought that my works could be shown in theatres. I can now confidently write a story, create animation and make a film, and show it to the world. This passion to create and share has built a strong bond among ourselves, but can also influence people.\nStaying in the studio and working through the night was often a great and unforgettable experience for us to strengthen our friendships. We worked, ate, played, and slept in our studio. Most importantly, we grew up together. Challenged by different projects, we faced pressure and tight schedules. We became friends and comrades in arms. Without you guys, I could not have finished this degree. We now also have a strong bond with people who graduate in SD, and practice in this industry, to take out into the world.\nSD is a big family. I would like to express my greatest appreciation to my tutors and friends for their support. Our tutors were parents on campus who guided, supported and took care of us. We were able to share every happy moment and problems with them. They give us the freedom to explore. Special thanks must go to Jae and Step, for giving us criticism when we fell in love with our ideas too much! They always put us back on track and encouraged us to step out of our comfort zone, they also helped broaden our horizons by showing us interesting things to help us to be better. I would not be where I am today without you guys by my side.\nIt is my pleasure to be valedictorian this year. I know what we learned from SD will last because design thinking skills matter. They will keep guiding us to make better decisions and influence society for the better.\nBut before that… take a rest and think back to how we conquered these two years at the School of Design. Congratulations to all of you! I wish you all continue to tackle design challenges and emerge triumphant in your work and your life. Good luck and keep in touch!\n(back to top)",

  "text": "From a spark of awareness to a series of action, behaviour is gradually formed and becoming a custom.\nOur response to environmental issues often begins with a blink of idea. To recycle and reuse is like a centre origin point, connecting different actions under the radius of similar concept, forming a continual round. This seemingly endless circular momentum, if we look at it from a slightly tilted angle, we see a dynamic movement going forward, picking up strength from each looping and extend into an ever going path.\nThrough this dynamic line, design connects people, objects and communities. From here, we can trace the origin to find out where design ideas come from, how it is closely related to our living and environment, affecting different aspects of daily life.\nToday, we realise that environmental protection is not solely about using eco-friendly materials, but all solutions must be achieved through careful planning, design and efficient use of resources. Also, the definition of sustainable development should not simply remain at the material level, but to extend to a metaphysical implication. Our cultural heritage, tradition, and aesthetics indeed are nutrients that shape our unique temperament and provide a continuous supply of inspiration nourishing our future development.\nKeep going, always by design.\nThe Material Resource Centre (MRC) of PolyU Design is pleased to join the exhibition to share our contribution to making the best use of materials with other brilliant exhibitors sharing similar thoughts.

With both local and non-local audiences from 3 online platforms (Zoom, Bilibili and Vshibo), there were a total of over 7000 cumulative audiences joining the forum.\nWe were glad to have 6 international design and business leaders—Prof. Francesco Zurlo, Mr André Nogueira, Prof. Peter Childs, Mr Hiroshi Tamura, Dr Jun Su and Mr James O — from both academic and industry to share their ideas on the significance of having the mindset, process and methods of design entrepreneurship under the vast development of business and technology in the modern age, and how education can keep up with the footsteps to nurture challenge-prepared talents.\nTo prepare students to face today’s multi-faceted challenges, soft skills and crossdisciplinary knowledge should be incorporated into the education of design. Notions like entrepreneurship, leadership, technology, diversity, and communication are addressed in the forum as elements going along with design thinking. Such a trend in the change of design education has been adopted in PolyU Design’s new BA curriculum, to train students to have the mindset of entrepreneurship and the ability to create a start-up business.\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, risks, uncertainties, and failures are inevitable. At the forum, our speakers encouraged the embracement of risks, uncertainties, and failures and the building of a fearless mentality in business and innovations. Aside from accepting the existence of possible obstacles, these leaders also suggested solutions to manage and minimise their impacts, by researching and prototyping.\nThe interactive dynamics between design and entrepreneurship was further illustrated in the panel discussions, divided in three aspects: (1) Design in Entrepreneurship, (2) Design for Entrepreneurship and (3) Design with Entrepreneurship. Conversation covering designers’ participation in an entrepreneurial organisation, effective design methods and tools in entrepreneurship and success in product and market performance allow further discussions and researches to shape the future of design, education and entrepreneurship.\nTo revise the speeches and discussions, stay tuned for videos at designedasia.com.",

  "text": "Congratulations to Team Kooly on receiving an honourable mention in the Student Service Design Challenge (SSDC) 2022 IKEA Service Design Spin-off Challenge in the Barcelona Design Week. Their project, Furn.up, scored high on the criterion ‘society oriented’ for their inclusive and sustainable service concept, will also be shown in the Dutch Design Week this October.\nTeam Kooly is a multicultural and highly interdisciplinary design team consisting of six master’s students in the Master of Design (MDes) and MSc Multimedia and Entertainment Technology (MSc MET) programmes: Christy Au-Yeung and Zhengtao Ma (MSc MET) and Hyunjin Kang, Justus Bremer, Mengyan Liu, and Xinrui Wang (MDes).\nThe team was formed out of their passion for sustainability and innovative service solutions, and all shared a vision to change the way people live through design. Through their knowledge in the fields of interaction, business and multimedia design, they explored the way of life in Hong Kong not only from an environmental perspective but also from a social perspective, rescuing the power of design in a comprehensive and highly specialised process.\nTeam Kooly: “We formed our team based on the premise of trying to involve students from a variety of different backgrounds. Overall, the main goal for us was to be able to learn from one another and get an understanding of all the different skills designers from different disciplines might have since we all have slightly different work and education backgrounds.”\n“Multinationality was an important factor for us. Our team includes students from four different regions of the world, one from Hong Kong, three from Mainland China, one from South Korea, and one from Germany. This way, we could also get a lot of different cultural viewpoints into this project, which was an important factor that ensured the success of our project.”\nThe SSDC is initiated by Philips Experience Design and co-organised with service design college in collaboration with IBM, IKEA, and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.",

  "text": "We are excited to announce that 'House of Dreams' won the UIA 2030 Award co-presented by the International Union of Architects (UIA) and UN-Habitat. \nHouse of Dreams was winner of the UIA 2030's Sustainable Development Goal #11 category. It was recognised for its 'collaborative effort between architect and local community extending through design and construction, in the revitalisation of a historical and cultural site.'\nThe House of Dreams is conducted by Insitu Project, a research platform co-led by Mr Peter Hasdell, Associate Dean of PolyU Design and Mr Kuo Jze Yi of the School of Architecture and Urban Planning in Shenzhen U. The revitalised cave settlement in Zhoushan village in Henan Province, completed in 2020, was co-designed and implemented by Insitu Project together with Liang Jun, the Zhoushan Community Group and Dr Ku Hok Bun from APSS of PolyU. \nThe 3-year project involved participatory design and construction, social design, and design led social innovation through the alignment of social initiatives with the architectural revitalization of the cave area. The project used a circular material economy approach and was constructed by villagers from recycled construction and household waste. Fostering a bottom-up self-built approach enabled the community to reduce construction costs, increase skills and community pride, at the same time enabling a circular material economy which cleaned up the village as a result. The outcome is uniquely composed of thousands of details, stories and collective memories. \nThe UIA 2030 Award is another prestigious international award received by the project in addition to other five honours within a year. Other awards include the Human City Design Award, Winner and People’s Choice awards under the Social Good category of Azure Awards 2022, Gold Medal in the Taipei International Design Award 2021, the Architecture MasterPrize (AMP) award in 2021 and a Bronze in the Design Educates Awards 2022. The project was also shortlisted for a Dezeen award, and an Architecture in Development 2021 award.",
